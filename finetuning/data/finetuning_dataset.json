The fundamental justification for a bridge inspection programme lies in the assurance of safety. Timely and economic planning and programming of remedial and preventive maintenance and repair work are dependent upon detailed bridge inspection. Inspection is aimed at identifying and quantifying deterioration, which may be caused by applied loads and factors such as deadload, liveload, wind load and physicalchemical influences exerted by the environment. Inspection is particularly necessary in case of old bridges not designed to modern loading standards. To identify actual and potential sources of trouble at the earliest possible stage. To record systematically and periodically the state of the structure. To impose speed restriction on the bridge if the condition situation warrants the same. To determine and report whether major rehabilitation of the bridge is necessary. Bridges over water are inspected at times of low water, generally after the monsoon. Bridges suspected of having trouble on account of thermal movement should be inspected during temperature extremes. The bridges are inspected starting from foundations and ending with superstructures. IRBM.IRBM: All the bridges are to be inspected by PWIsIOWs once a year before monsoon and by AENsonce a year after monsoon. All the steel structures are inspected by BRIs once in 5 years and selected bridges by Bridge EngineersDyCE as and when found necessary. The following equipments are required for thorough inspection of the various elements of bridges. For major girder bridges, stress sheets are useful. Pocket tape, chipping hammer, plumb bob and 30 metre steel tape are also needed. Ladders, Scaffolding, Boats or barges, Echo sounders, Levelling equipment to assess camber and Dye penetration test equipment to detect cracks specially in welds. Inspection of Bridge can be effective only if the inspection official is well equipped with support system. Common facilities for bridge inspection includes the chequered plate on the steel girder bridge. to reach to the bridge site either by rail or by road depending upon this the inspecting official has to plan for necessary arrangement for detailed inspection of bridge. The biggest drawback of these arrangements is doubt about the safety 8and reliability of these non engineered structures. Many times these techniques require heavy equipment and generator. In western countries Mobile Bridge Inspection Units MBIUs are being used for inspection of bridges. The first MBIU has been introduced by Northern Railways in 2010 to facilitate inspection of bridges. In routine 10-12 workmen are required for technical inspection of a bridge. By deploying this unit merely 6 workmen can carry out the same quantum of technical inspection. MBIU consists of 2 units Power Pack vehicle Inspection vehicle. The Power Pack is self propelled vehicle Fig.1.9 having front and rear driving cabins. Cummins NTA 855R diesel engines of 340 HP suitable for max driving speed of 70 kmph. The inspection vehicle is manufactured and supplied by MOOG GMBH, German assembled at RCFKXH. Power equipment of inching operation is provided on the inspection vehicle. This vehicle can run in both the directions at same speed. The range of inspection arm in horizontal plane is 8.00 m. on either side from centerline of track. The broad recommendations for providing inspection arrangements can be as follows. Temporary arrangement is sufficient for bridge with low to moderate height. Bridges with abnormal height or inaccessible river bed may have permanent arrangements. Sections where line block is a problem or numbers of bridges are large may have road inspection vehicle. Open line maintenance unit of railway often felt handicapped due to non availability of completion plan and detailed drawings. Non availability of foundation plan and detailing poses serious challenges related to safe load carrying capacity as and when loading standard is revised or upgraded. Non availability of structural detailing and plan of old bridges make it practically impossible to take decision on load carrying capacity and residual life of bridge. Non destructive testing in conjunction with detailed finite element modeling and analysis, some idea on the above can be obtained. There may be certain assumptions and special features which would be difficult to visualize at later stage without the aid of either suitable documentation or by narration from the executing personals. It is therefore necessary that the documentation consists of detailed planning, assumptions, analysis, design and unanticipated problems. Detailed inspection of a bridge is required to be done starting from foundation right up to superstructure, including the track. Approaches of bridges should also be inspected for scour, settlement etc. In many bridges where open foundations are provided, some 16RIVER FLOW PLAN H.F.L. ation material can be easily probed to ascertain whether the construction material is showing signs of deterioration or distress. The deterioration can be on account of weathering of the material, leaching of mortar etc. A serious problem, which is frequently encountered around piers and abutments is scour. This is the erosive action of running water in loosening and carrying away material from the bed and banks of the river. Three types of scour affect bridges as described below. Local scour is most likely around the following 1. Nose of pier 2. Head of the guide-bund 3. Down-stream side of skew bridge 4. Outside of curve in a bend in the course of the river stream, etc. Inspection during dry season might only indicate possible locations where excessive scour occurred. Measurement of scour should be carried out in rainy season during medium floods. Such measurements can be analyzed to ascertain the grip length of deep foundations available during flood conditions. Undermining of deep foundations leads to tilting or sinking of a pier. Uneven settlement of foundations can occur on account of difference in the loading pattern in different parts of the pier or abutment. Different soil strata below the foundation may also cause uneven settlement. The differential settlement may lead to tilting of abutments or piers. It is difficult to measure the tilt, mainly because of the front batter generally provided on these structures. Observations are taken from time to time and the new markings are compared with previous ones. Crushing and cracking of masonry generally occurs in portions of bridge structure, which carry excessive dynamic impact. Surface deterioration will be indicated by layers of material spalling off. Areas of the bridge structure which undergo alternate drying and wetting are prone to weathering damage. Lime mortar and cement mortar with free lime content are subject to leaching because of action of rain and running water. This defect can be identified by removing the mortar from a few places by raking out the joints with the help of a small sharp knife. 2.5 Transverse cracks in piers are rarely observed. These cracks can arise because of increased longitudinal forces coming over the pier and thereby creating tensile stresses. The increase in longitudinal forces may also be caused by freezing of bearings as a result of improper maintenance. Cracks can be traced to long gaps between two successive concrete lifts usually on account of intervention of rainy season. When construction work is recommended in such situations, precautions are required to be taken. A good practice would be to provide dowel bars at the interface.  flooring is provided in bridges with shallow foundations so as to prevent scour. Curtain walls and drop walls are provided to prevent disturbance to the flooring itself. Maintaining these works in proper condition is as important as maintenance of the bridge structure itself. Stone pitching is some times provided on approach banks constructed in the khadir of alluvial rivers to prevent erosion of the bank. Pitching is also provided on guide bunds and spurs for the same purpose. Toe wall is an important component of pitching and if the toe wall gets damaged, pitching is likely to slip into the water. Guide bunds are provided generally in alluvial rivers to train the river stream through the bridge. On many of the bigger and longer guide bunds, a siding is laid to work ballast trains for transporting boulders. The track of the siding must be maintained in proper condition. Guide bunds constructed on clayey soils need special attention as regards scouring at the base. Scouring may cause a vertical cut below the toe of guide bund which may ultimately result in failure. This is particularly possible at mole heads. For effectiveness and meaningful inspection of arch bridges, it is essential that the inspecting official is conversent with the nomenclature of variouscomponents of an arch bridge. The various parts of the arch bridge are shown in Fig.2.14. Cracks in abutments and piers indicate uneven settlement of foundations. These cracks should be grouted with cement epoxy mortar and tell tale provided to observe further propogation, if any. The difference in stiffness between the spandrel wall, which acts like a deep beam, and the flexible arch barrel results in incompatibility of deflections at their junction. Such cracks are not considered serious, but they must be kept under observation. Many times, track level on the arch is raised bit by bit and new masonry courses are added on the sp andrel wall. The drainage of the arch should never be sought to be improved by drilling holes through the arch barrel as it may lead to shaking of the barrel masonry. Improvements can be made by clearing weep holes in the spandrel wall and providing suitable back fill material over a strip of about 450 mm. Sometimes, longitudinal cracks are noticed in the arch, away from spandrel wall. These cracks may occur due to differential deflections of the part of arch barrel subjected to live load and the remaining part. The underlying cause should be identified and appropriate remedial action taken. Cracks in spandrel wall originating above the piers may be caused by sinking of pier. This is obviously a serious crack and needs immediate strengthening of foundation. Cracking and crushing of masonry can be traced to weathering of stonesbricks, excessive loading and inadequate cushion over the crown. Leaching out of limecement mortar in the barrel can be traced to poor drainage. Water trapped in the fill above the arch seeps through the joints. The remedy lies in grouting the joints and improving the drainage through the weep holes in the spandrel wall. Cracks always progress along the weakest planes in the structure, and in case of stone masonry the weakest plane is 39along the mortar joint. These cracks indicate serious weakness in the arch and need proper investigation and adoption of appropriate strengthening measures. Hakken bed block is used to indicate falling of mortar from the pointing done at the joints between the bed block and the adjoining masonry. After a mason completes cement mortar pointing, a train running on the bridge before adequate time has passed will result in falling of this pointing. Falling of pointing is not synonymous to shaken bed blocks. The bearings of all girder bridges should be generally cleaned and greased once in three years. Bearings could be of the following tipes 1. Sliding bearings 2. Roller and Rocker bearings 3. Elastomeric bearings 4. P.T.F.E. As per item no. 1046 of BSC-82 the Railway Board order that RDSO shall issue necessary CS when LWR is carried over girder bridge. Sliding bearings Fig. 2.27 should be inspected for the following 1. Oiling and greasing of plain bearings is required to be done once in 3 years. In the case of flat bearings, the girder is lifted a little over 6mm. For spans above 12.2 m, special jacking beams will have to be inserted and jacks applied. The bearings are scraped, polished with zero grade sand paper and grease graphite of sufficient quantity to keep surfaces smooth. Phosphor bronze bearings need not be greased as they are corrosion resistant and retain the smooth surface. Excessive corrosion may cause the bearing to freeze or lock and become incapable of movement. The rockers, pins and rollers should be free of corrosion and debris. The tilt of segmental rollers should be measured with respect to reference line and the temperature at the time of measurement should also be noted. In case of roller bearings with oil baths, dust covers should invariably be provided to keep the oil free from dirt. Elastomers creep under continuously applied stress. Natural rubber stiffens less than chloroprene. Chloroprenes usually creep more but are less susceptible to chemical deterioration. Elastomeric bearing will permit translation along any direction and rotation around any axis.  vertical stiffness is a function of shear modulus and total thickness of elastomer. Low values of shape factor should be avoided since bulging and low elastic modulus are likely to occur. Closely spaced steel plates are used to increase the shape factor. High values for the material result in bearings which are too stiff. Elastomeric bearings are considered largely to be maintenance free. However due to possible deficiencies in manufacture and installation, these bearings may show signs of distress or develop malfunctioning. The bearings should also be examined for excessive rotation which is usually indicated by excessive difference in thickness. Elastomeric bearing will undergo deformations due to load and movement of the girder. The bearing shall be examined for the followings a compression flattening, b bulge and c shear. PTFE is a short form of poly-tetra fluoro ethylene. The mating surface, which forms the upper component, is stainless steel with good surface furnish. Lubricating the mating surface by silicone grease reduces the coefficient of friction. Pure PTFE has a low compressive strength, high thermal expansion and very low thermal conductivity. These detrimental properties can be improved by the use of fillers like glass fibre and bronze. This type of bearing is also used in incremental launching construction. The coefficient of friction of PTFE Stainless Steel bearings reduces with increase in contact stress. This property is advantageously used since any overload will reduce the frictional coefficient thereby maintaining the same stress level in sub-structures. Lubricating the mating surface by silicone grease reduces the coefficient of friction. Pot-cum-PTFE bearings are designed and manufactured so as to make it almost maintenance free. The surrounding area of the bearings shall always be kept clean and dry. The bearings are required to be inspected at an interval of one year for the first five years. The inspection shall be preceded by careful cleaning of the bearings and its surrounding space. In Pot-cum-PTEF bearings, confined elastomeric pad is used to permit rotation. Tolerance between metallic cylinder and pot is very light, the rotational capacity of the bearing is affected. Another problem is inability 52of steel pot to withstand the transverse loading. Measurement of movement - During inspection at site, measurements are required to be taken and documented. The recoded value of movement shall be compared with the design values. Measurement of dimensions is required to ascertain any excessive stress or strain on the bearing. If any moveable or rotating part of a bearing is found to be in locked-in jammed condition, necessary rectification measures shall be taken immediately. root cause of defect should be 53searched and remedial actions should be planned to avoid recurrence of the problem. Condition of the adjacent bridge structure - The adjacent structure of the bearings are also required to be inspected for any damage. Camber is provided in the girder to compensate for deflection under load. It is checked by using dumpy level or precision level on all intermediate panel points. Getting design camber after erection is an indication of good fabrication and erection work. Initial camber is recored once the girder is place into service. The camber as observed during detailed inspection is compared with the initial camber recorded after erection. If one observes loss of camber, then the bridge girder should be thoroughly inspected to identify the cause. Girder members which are likely to show signs of distortion are. Top chord members on account of insufficient restraint by bracings. Tension members made up of flats because of mishandling during erection. Diagonal web members generally subjeted to reversal of loading. Testing for loose rivets by this method is not allowed for the girders which are metalized aluminum so as not to cause mechanical damage to the coating layer. The inspection of High Strength Friction Grip HSFG bolts shall be done visually for broken and loose bolts. The brokenloose bolts, if any, shall be marked and shall be replaced expeditiously. Critical areas for loose rivets HSFG bolts are 1. Top flange of plate girders 2. Connection between rail bearer and cross girder in open web girdes. 3. Gussets at panel points of open web Girders. 4. Water pockets formed on account of co-coating. The presence of moisture aggravates corrosion. Proper drainage on structures such as troughed decks or boxes formed at panel points of through girders or concrete decks must be ensured. Special attention should be paid to the following locations 1. Places where dust accumulates. 2. nstructional features. It is important to assess the magnitude of corrosion and consequent loss of effective structural section. Members and connections subject to high stress fluctuations and stress reversals are the most common suspect in respect of corrosion. Due to corrossion, loss of cross sectional area takes place, which may leads to development of cracks. Cracking because of repeated stresses is one of the major causes of potential failures in steel structures. Fatigue is becoming important because of the growing volume of traffic, greater speed and higher axle load. One should look for such fatigue cracks where the intensity of traffic is heavy and the steel is old. Even steel which was manufactured between 1895 and 1905 should be treated as suspect and inspected at an increased frequency. Factors causing deterioration in concrete can be listed as follows. Poor design details. Construction deficiencies like inadequate cover, improper compaction and curing etc. Cracks in the web near the support indicate excessive shear stress and are of serious nature. Cracks which occur near the bearings may be caused by movement in the foundation. Chemical attack and high alkali cement can also cause cracks. Longitudinal cracks at soffit of slabs or beams running along reinforcement bars indicate corrosion of reinforcement. These are mainly because of honeycombing in concrete and inadequate cover which lead to ingress of moisture. Bridge decks and corners of girders are particularly susceptible to delamination. Scaling may be light, medium, heavy or severe depending upon the depth and exposure of aggregate. Spalling occurs with the transfer of excessive dynamic forces in the vicinity of bearings. Spalling can be identified by tapping the area with a small chipping hammer when hollow sound is heard. Spalling may also occur wherever there is honeycombing or bad compaction or bad quality of concrete. Non-placement of wearing coat will lead to wear of concrete surface. Carbonation of 2 concrete is a process by which carbon dioxide from the air penetrates into concrete through pores and reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium carbonates. CO by itself is not reactive. But in the presence of moisture, CO changes into dilute carbonic 2 acid, which attacks the concrete and reduces alkalinity of concrete. Arbonation of concrete is one of the main reasons for corrosion of reinforcement. A common and simple method for establishing the extent of carbonation is to treat the freshly broken surface of concrete with a solution of phenolphthalein in diluted alcohol. The corrosion of reinforcement generally leads to cracking or spalling of concrete. Corrosion is indicated by staining of concrete deep brown or red colour. The reinforcement corrosion problem basically arises from seepage of water through concrete decks. Cracks occur on account of differential shrinkage between the concrete of pre-cast element and cast-in-place element. These cracks can not be avoided and should not be viewed as serious cracks at the first instance. They must be kept under observation along with the camber of the girder. Temperatures of prestressed concrete girders should be recorded and compared with the previous values. Progressive loss of camber is an important indication of 69deterioration in the condition of bridge and, therefore, should be thoroughly investigated. Cracks developed due to excessive of deck slab tension Delamination Blocking of drainage Worn out wearing coat. Damage by abrasive action of ballast once in 5 years Seepage Corrosion signs Leaching Scaling Damage due to accident or any other causes.

Rail joints should be avoided within 3 metres of a bridge abutment. Full ballast section should be maintained for atleast upto 50 metres on the approaches. Spacing and depth of timbers should be as per Table 2.3. At fishplated joints the clear spacing should not exceed 200 mm. End binding is done using 6 mm MS bars at 75 mm inside the end of the timber. End bolts should be provided on timbers which have developed end splits. Indian Railway switched over to steel sleepers in place of bridge timbers. Nylon fibre chord reinforced elastomeric rubber pads are provided below these sleepers to provide resilience. The pads are required to be suitably grooved and pasted on top of flange plates. Clear spacing between sleepers should not be more than 450 mm. These steel sleepers are galvanized hot dip galvanizing and do not need any painting over it. Relevent RDSO drawings are 1. ttached sheet. Sloping lip hook bolts are used for rolled sections and straight lipped for built-up girders with flange plates. Hook bolts should be oiled periodically to prevent rusting. angle tie bar using ISA 75x50x8 mm may be provided on top of sleeper. Shank of book bolts are specially designed so that it is round at upper half and rectangular at lower half. Rail-free fastenings should be used on all unballasted deck bridges to avoid transfer of longitudinal forces to the bridge. Guard rails should be provided on all girder bridges which donot have ballasted deck or having open hodc. Top table of guard rails should not be lower than that of the running rail by more than 25 mm. At the extremities of the guard rail outside the bridge the end should be bent vertically and buried and a block of timber fixed at 75. The committee has made the following recommendations 2.9.4. The project proposal for taking up the project with UIC Asias already submitted to Railway Board was also discussed. The additional stresses in 60 Kg 90 UTS rails can be provisionally permitted as under Addl. compressive stress 60Nmm2 6.0 Kgmm2 and Tensile stress 75Nmm 2 7. LWRCWR may be continued over bridges of multiple spans individual span up to 24.4mup to total bridge length of 110m. If Elastomeric bearings without any restraint in longitudinal direction are used, LWRCWR can be continued. The SEJ shall be provided minimum 100m away from Bridge abutment. The arrangement of creep anchors shall be as per standard design issued by RDSO. Such bridges provided with LWR will be instrumented for measuring longitudinal force. The detailed study is necessary to allow continuation of LWR on longer bridges and to rationalize the stipulations. RDSO will act as the nodal center for checking of the bridges and rail stresses as per the software. IRBM specifically provides for under water inspection of all bridges where substructure and foundations are perennially under water. Underwater inspection is a specialized operation and very expensive and therefore, it necessitates careful consideration of bridges to be selected for inspection. More frequent inspections may be necessary for critical structures. Inspection frequency may have to be increased for those bridges where deterioration has been noticed during previous inspections. It must also be carried out after any collision with the bridge substructure or after a major storm so that physical evidence is inspected and recorded. Wading inspection is the basic method of underwater inspection. Wading inspection can often be performed by regular bridge inspection teams. Scuba stands for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus. The maximum sustained time and working depth in scuba diving is one hour at 18 m depth. An expert diver can go up to 36 m for short duration of about 10 minutes. Moderate to good visibility is necessary for inspection. The areas of coral or jagged rock should be avoided. Scuba diving with mixed gas is used for the same situations as normal Scuba diving. It has the advantage of extending the diving time for a great deal. The disadvantage is that it needs more preparation and equipment. With a full-face mask it is possible to use 82communication.  Surface supplied air diving uses a body suit, a hard helmet covering the head and a surface supplied air system. Air is supplied to the diver through umbilical hoses connected to the surface air compressor tank. It requires more equipment than the Scuba diving. Work limit for Kirby Morgan mask MK1 without come home bottle is 60 minutes at 18 m. Maximum for MK1 with open bell is 10 minutes at 40 m. with Jack Brown mask are60 minutes at about 18 m depth and up to 30 minutes at a depth of 27 m.  depth of water alone should not be the sole criteria for determining whether a bridge can be inspected by wading or it requires the use of diving equipment. Water depth - Current velocity - Underwater visibility - Substructure configuration - Stream bed condition - Debris The three levels of inspections are Level I Visual, tactile inspection Level II Detailed inspection with partial cleaning Level III Highly detailed inspection with non-destructive testing 3.6.1 Level I is a general visual inspection. The Level I effort can confirm as-built structural plans. A Level II inspection is a detailed visual inspection where detailed investigations of selected components or sub components or critical areas of structure are carried out. This type of inspection will generally involve prior or concurrent cleaning of part of the structural element. On pile structure, 25 cm high bands should be cleaned at designated locations. On large faced elements, such as piers and abutments, 30 cm by 30 cm area should be cleaning at 3 levels on each face of the structure. The dive team should have access to the appropriate tools and equipments as warranted by the type of inspection being conducted. Level III inspection will require considerably more experience and training than Level I or Level II inspections. Still photographs and video records facilitate in-depth documentation of underwater inspection. Video systems can provide pictorial representation of existing conditions, transmit visual data to topside personnel for analysis and interpretation. On-site recording of all conditions is essential. Sketches should be used as much as possible providing enough detail. Tape recordings when significant damage is encountered can also prove helpful. All photographs should be numbered, dated and labelled with a brief description of the subject. Videotapes should be provided with a title and lead-in, describing what is on the tape. North-east Frontier Railway conducted under water inspection of Bridge No.209 on River Sunkosh in Permanent Way section Juri- 89Srirampur of APDJ Division during 2007. Bridge is founded on 9.1 meter dia well and constructed in 1993. Pier No.4, 5 6 perennially under water are having cracks, blow holes etc. Based on RDSO vide Report No. BS 96 2008 Guidelines for Underwater Inspection of Bridges. The present method of bridge inspection is mostly visual. For detailed and quantitative assessment of the health of the bridge, non destructive tests NDT should be used. A variety of non destructive methods are available which can be used for estimation of strength and other properties of bridge structures. The various NDT methods for assessing the condition of concrete bridges are given below. For detailed procedure of these NDT tests, IRICEN publication on Non Destructive Testing of Bridges may be referred. The rebound of an elastic mass depends on the hardness of the surface against which mass strikes. The rebound value is read off along a graduated scale and is designated as the rebound number or rebound index. The compressive strength can be read directly from the graph provided on the body of the hammer. Digital concrete test hammer is a microprocessor operated standard unit equipped with electronic transducer which converts the rebound of the hammer into electric signal. It is battery operated instrument and can be easily connected to a PC and has large memory to store up to 5000 results. The velocity of an ultrasonic pulse through any material depends upon the density, modulus of elasticity and Poissons ratio of the material. Comparatively higher velocity is obtained when concrete quality is good in terms of density, uniformity, homogeneity etc. For good quality concrete pulse velocity will be higher and for poor quality it will be less. Pulse velocity depends on materials and mix proportions of concrete. Density and modulus of elasticity of aggregate also significantly affect the pulse velocity. The quality of concrete in terms of uniformity, can be assessed using the guidelines given in the Table 4.1 below. The pull-off test is based on the concept that the tensile force required to pull a metal disk, together with a layer of concrete, from the surface to which it is attached, is related to compressive strength of concrete. In this test, a steel disk is glued to the surface of the concrete with the help of epoxy resin. A pulling force on the metal disk through a bolt screwed axially to it The pull-out test subjects the concrete to slowly applied load and measures actual strength property of the concrete. The test is considered superior to the rebound hammer and the penetration resistance test, because large volume and greater depth of concrete are involved in the test. Probe of diameter 6.35 to 7.94 mm and length of about 79.5 mm is used. Probe is threaded into the probe driving 96head and fired into the concrete using a template. Exposed length is correlated to the compressive strength of the concrete. The equipment consists of data logger, diameter probe, depth probe and calibration block. The equipment works on normal batteries and thus does not require any electric connection. The instrument is based upon measurement of change of an electromagnetic field caused by the steel embedded in the concrete. The cover is measured by placing the probe over the surface of the concrete and dial reading gives the cover to the reinforcement depending upon the diameter of the bar. Cover to reinforcement can be measured up to 100 mm with an accuracy of 15 and bar diameter with accuracy of 2 to 3 mm. The equi-potential lines intersect the surface of the concrete and the potential at any point can be measured. Apparatus for half cell potential measurement is shown in fig. 4.5. The resistivity test combined with Half Cell potentiometer test gives more reliable results about the corrosion condition of the rebar. This is based on the principle that the corrosion of steel in concrete is an electro-chemical process. The depth of carbonation can be measured by spraying the freshly fractured concrete surface with a 0.2 solution of phenolphthalein in ethanol. The area with pink colour presents uncarbonated concrete and the remaining colourless portion, the carbonated area. The chloride content of concrete can also be determined by chemical analysis of concrete in the laboratory. A rotary percussion drill is used to collect a pulverized sample of concrete and a special acid extracts the chlorides. This method can be used for detection of cracks in concrete as well as steel structures. Acoustic emission test may be carried out in the laboratory or in the field. Basically one or more acoustic emission transducers are attached to the specimen. The specimen is then loaded slowly and the resulting acoustic emissions recorded for further processing. Endoscopy consists of inserting a rigid or flexible viewing tube into holes drilled into concrete bridge components or cable ducts. Light provided by optical glass fibers from an external source. This is a most useful method for inspecting or detecting voids in the grout. The boroscope can be used to gain information of the depth of the outer layer of bricks or natural stones. For steel structures the method is usually used for investigation of closed profiles. It may also be used for inspections of structural components such as expansion joints and honeycombs. The various NDT methods for assessing the condition of masonry bridges are given below. 4.3.1 Flat Jack testing This test is used to determine the compressive strength and in- situ stress of the masonry. A flat jack is a flexible steel enveloper thin enough to fit within a masonry mortar joint. The technique involves a hammer striking a masonry surface, with a receiving transducer located near the impact joint. The response, then can be interpreted to detect flaws within masonry structure. This technique can be used for determining overall soundness of the masonry. Infrared Thermography is also known as heat imagery. Camera or video equipments are used to photograph the surface temperature of the object. Results indicate whether the masonry is densesound or porousdeteriorated. Liquid penetrant inspection is a fast and relatively easy method to apply in field. LPI produces a flaw indication that is much larger and easier for the eye to detect. Internal cracksblow holes etc. cannot be detected using this method. MPI uses magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks in steel structures. Ferromagnetic materials are materials that can be magnetized to a level that will allow the inspection to be effective. Eddy currents are created through a process called electromagnetic induction. The method may be used effectively for inspection of steel girders and other bridge parts made of steel. Radiographic testing is a technique to obtain a shadow image of a solid using penetrating radiation such as X-rays or gamma rays. Eddy current equipment can be used for a variety of applications such as detection of cracks discontinuity, measurement of metal thickness and determination of coating thickness. An ultrasonic transducer changes high frequency pulsating voltage into vibrational energy. When properly coupled to steel with cellulose gum or glycerine, to eliminate air space, most of the sound energy is conducted to the steel for testing. Ultrasonic testing can be used to inspect base metal or welds for inclusions, voids, cracks and laminations. Both surface and sub- surface discontinuities can be detected. Their size, location and orientation can be closely delineated. The register is thereafter forwarded to the DEN Sr.DENCBE for scrutiny and orders. All major and important bridges shall be examined by CBE and all the remaining bridges by a SAG officer nominated by PCE. Action taken on the instructions of officers AEN onwards is also to be recorded in the register. NRS for bridges have been evolved in UK and USA over the last few years. It is essentially a method of examination and assessment which gives, by means of a simple figure code, quick appreciation of the physical condition of the bridge. The system provides a means of recording progressive deterioration. A condition rating number is assigned to each of the bridge components i.e. foundation and flooring, sub-structure, training and protection works, bed blocks, bearings and expansion arrangements, superstructure and track structure. The numerical rating is not in any way linked to load carrying capacity. Each case has to be judged and rating decided on its merits by the inspecting officer.

ORN ORN for the bridge as a whole is also to be given. CRN of a bridge component shall be the lowest rating  URN 20362544 indicates the following Digit Number Indication Value 1 2 Whole bridge or one or more of its ORN components require rebuildingrehabilitation on programmed basis. 2 0 Foundation and flooring were not inspected. 3 3 Substructure requires majorspecial repairs. 4 6 Not applicable i.e. the bridge does not have any training or protection works. The physical condition of a road over bridge is to be represented similar to a rail bridge. This is because in the bridge inspection registers for minor bridges used by most of the Railways, separate columns are not available for recording the condition of the various bridge components. All bridges rated with ORN 1 or 2 should be placed in the distressed category I and II respectively. Bridge components which have CRN as 0 should be inspected by AEN at the earliest. Lack of maintenance generally results in reduced life and deterioration in the bridge structure. In the olden days, bridge substructures were constructed in brick or stone masonry in lime mortar. Over the years the lime mortar in the joints becomes weak and cracks develop in the masonry. The distress can also be on account of weakness in any part of the structure. Weathering of masonry Joints - Superficial - Pointing Deep - Grouting with cement or epoxy - Plaster the masonry Leaching of lime mortar - Cement grouting - Guniting. Horizontal cracks - Increase the section by jacketing. Backfill drain - Weep holes - Soil Anchoringrock anchoring - Jacketing - Rebuilding 119. Inspection before monsoon of guide bundspur etc. air.

Steel Girders Riveted and welded Plate Girder Open Web Grider i Early steel - Replace the girder - Check with reduced stresses. If the crack is propagating in a direction perpendicular to the stress in member, holes 20 or 22 mm dia may be drilled at crack ends to arrest the crack propagation. As a long term solution the cracked member may be strengthened by cover plate s. If this is not feasible, the defective member may have to be taken out and repairedreplaced. Cracks not progressive may be due to overload or bad of camber riveting. Regirder the bridge - Lift the panel joints and re-rivet the girder joints. Field welding should not be undertaken for repair of cracks. Crack in Concrete Slab girder should be marked distinctly with paint for easy identification. Repair and retrofit scheme should be prepared after fully investigating the cause. Epoxy grouting may be done to bind the deck slab and the girder where the defect is noticed. Cement pressure grouting and epoxy injection can be adopted for repairing deficiencies a, b and c above. For repairing disintegrated masonry concrete or spalled concrete, guniting is normally done. Loose joints around bed blocks in stone or brick masonry can be repaired either by epoxy grouting or cement grouting. Cracks may be separated into two classes for the purposes of deciding upon the type of repair. Dormant cracks which are not likely to open, close or extend further. These are also called dead cracks. Live cracks which may be subjected to further movement. G.I. pipes 12 to 20 mm dia and 200 mm long with a threaded end are inserted and fixed with rich cement mortar. All the cracks are cut open to a V shaped groove, cleaned and sealed. Grout holes should be sluiced with water one day before grouting. Cement grouting with water-cement ratio of 0.4 to 0.5 is done from bottom to top and left to right using grout injecting machine. Curing with water is to be done for 14 days over the grouted portion. The structures built of stone masonry, brick masonry or concrete get affected by prolonged weathering action. The ingress of moisture sometimes associated with the extraneous chemicals such as nitrates, chlorides and sulphates combined with either proximity of sea or aggressive ground soil conditions accelerate the deterioration. Epoxy resins consist of condensation products of Epichlorohydrin and Bisphenol-A. They are thermosetting with high adhesive strength and practically no shrinkage with good resistance to wear and to most of the chemicals. Nails are driven into the cracks at 15 to 30 cm interval. Holes of 7-10 mm dia should be drilled along the cracks. copper, aluminum or polythene pipe pieces 40 to 50 mm long are inserted around the nails and allowed to rest on them. Epoxy is injected from the bottom most pipe, keeping all other pipes, except the adjacent one, blocked by wooden plugs. The injection is done using suitable nozzles connected to air compressor or by modified grease guns or hand operated guns. It is recommended that persons who work with epoxy wear rubber gloves. Cracks which do not endanger the concrete structure can be filled atleast partially with epoxy putty epoxy, hardener and china clay. A crack resulting from a rare load-application can be repaired if it is wider than 0.3 to 0.4 mm by pressure injection. The material used for crack injection must be such as to penetrate easily into the crack and provide durable adhesion between the cracked surfaces. The formulations of commercially available injection resins vary widely in their properties. Care must be exercised in making proper selection. Some epoxy based low- viscous resin will penetrate to the crack-root even when the crack width at the surface is only about 0.2 mm. Acrylic resins are capable of sealing fine cracks because of their low viscosity. Fast reactive systems will only close the crack at its surface, which may not be desirable. The following table gives general idea about selection of materials for repair of cracks. Improvement of workability will be obtained if the cement suspension is formed by using high speed mixers. As a rule, the following steps are necessary for crack repair. If the cracks are less than 0.2 mm wide, entry ports should not be spaced more than 150 mm apart. intermediate ports should be inserted. Port spacing in cracks extending the full depth of the member are given in Table 7.2. Injecting the injection material through the nipples against gravity unless the crack is horizontal, in a progressive serial order. Re-injection and testing, if required or found necessary. Different injection equipments are available, depending on whether the materials are premixed or used separately. The viscosity of the resin strongly influences the rate of injection, especially for small crack widths and in reaching the crack root. The penetration 137138speed of the injection resin does not increase proportionately, with increasing pressure. Corrosion of reinforcement may be caused by contamination of the concrete with aggressive ions such as chlorides. The first step must be to remove unsound concrete. If any corroded reinforcement is present, the concrete should be cut back far enough to ensure that all corroded areas are exposed. The area to be cut out should be delineated with a saw, cut to a depth of about 5 mm in order to provide a neat edge.  Dust should be removed, as far as possible, from the surface of the concrete before patching material is applied. Oil free compressed air jets are effective on small areas but they merely tend to redistribute dust on large areas. Industrial vacuum cleaners can be more effective. Bonding coat should be applied to all exposed surfaces. thickness of dense concrete cover is important. Resin based materials do not generally provide an alkaline environment. Typical proportions would be two part cement to one part polymer latex. Hand applied repairs usually consist of cement and sand mortar in proportions of 12.5 or 13, using coarse sand. Repair mortar should be as stiff as possible consistent with full compaction and it should be rammed into place as forcibly as possible. It is necessary to apply a primer or tack coat of unfilled resin to the freshly exposed surface of concrete and reinforcement. emoval of dust is particularly important. Resin based materials cure by chemical reaction which starts immediately after the constituents are mixed. Resin-based repairs do not generally need any protection during their curing period, which is usually quite brief. Repairs consisting of cement, aggregates and water require careful curing by covering with absorbent material that is kept damp. The cement gun conforming to IS6433 is operated throughout by compressed air. The sand used should comply with the requirements given in IS 383 and graded evenly from fine to coarse. The optimum moisture content for sand is in the range of 3 to 6. The water-cement ratio for concrete used in this process is normally in the range of 0.35 to 0.50. For a length of hose upto 30 m the air pressure at the nozzle shall be 3.0 kg per sq.cm or more. The stone or brick masonry surface shall be cleared of all loose mortar, dust, moss, etc. and washed down with a strong jet of air or water. If mortar at the joint is weak, the joint shall be raked to about 10 mm depth. The form work, if required, shall be of plywood or other suitable material fixed in proper alignment and also to proper dimensions. The amount of rebound concrete varies with the position of work, angle of nozzle, air pressure, cement content, water content, size and grading of aggregate, amount of reinforcement and thickness of layer. Rebound shall not be worked back into construction. 7.1 General Railways are often required to undertake strengthening of existing bridge substructures. Jacketing should be undertaken only when the existing structure is fairly sound and does not show signs of distress. All cracks should be thoroughly grouted before providing the jacket. Site and soil conditions including water table shall be considered for deciding the width of foundation to be exposed at a time. Minimum thickness of jacketing should be at least 150 mm. For driving of dowels many times holes are required to be made. These holes must be drilled and not made by pavement breakers. The new concrete layer should be of minimum cube strength of 250 kg per sq.cm at 28 days. A mat of steel reinforcement bars spaced at minimum 200 mm horizontally and vertically may be provided as distribution reinforcement. The concrete should be cured for a minimum period of 28 days by covering with gunny bags or similar material and splashing with water. The duration of protection afforded by a given painting scheme when applied to a well-prepared surface is many times more as compared to that obtained on a badly prepared surface. Removal of rust, oil, grease and dirt is necessary to ensure adequate adhesion of paint film to the surface. A properly sand blasted steel surface appears silvery grey in colour. Flame cleaning by directing an oxyacetylene flame on the steel surface and then wire brushing is another method. After passage of flame the surface is cleaned by wire brush, sand papered and dusted. The painting schedule is to be adopted in areas where corrosion is NOT SEVERE. If for any reason, painting cannot immediately follow surface preparation, corrosion can be prevented for a short time by means of temporary coating of linseed oil. Special care should be taken to shift sleepers on girders or rail bearers to clean the seating very thoroughly before applying the paint. Paint should be mixed in small quantities sufficient to be consumed within 1 hour in the case of red lead paint and 5 days in the cases of red oxide paint. A new brush, before use, should be soaked in raw linseed oil for at least 24 hours. Brush shall not be less than 5 cm in width and should have good flexible bristles. Dust settled after scraping shall be cleaned before applying paint. The applied coat of paint shall be uniform and free from brush marks, sags, blemishes, scattering, crawling, uneven thickness, holes, lap marks, lifting, peeling, staining, cracking, checking, scaling, holidays and allegatoring. The paint should not be allowed to settle down during painting by frequent stirring or mixing. Protective coating by way of metallising or by painting with epoxy based paints may be applied. In metallised protection base metal like zinc or aluminium is lost by the atmospheric action, while the base metal steel remains unaffected. Zinc or aluminium can be sprayed on the surface prepared by gritsand blasting. Final cleaning is done by abrasives i.e. Chilled iron grit G.24 or Washed salt free angular silica sand of mesh size 12 to 30 with a minimum of 40 retained on a 20 mesh screen. The final surface roughness achieved shall be comparable to roughness with a reference surface produced in accordance with Appendix A of IS 5909. The minimum thickness of metal coating applied shall be 110 microns and average thickness 150 microns. The composition of the aluminium to be sprayed shall be preferably in accordance with BS 1475, material 1-B 99.5 aluminium otherwise as per IS 739. Clean dry air at a pressure of not less than 4.218 kg per sq.cm. The calibration of the gauge should be checked against a standard of similar thickness within an accuracy of 10 per cent. If a surface is properly metallised, the metallising layer between the two lines shall not come off. The surface is cleaned of all oil, dirt and other foreign material. The painting may be applied by brush or by spray. The need for periodical repainting and the method to be followed will depend on the condition of the existing paint. In most cases complete removal of existing paint film may not be necessary. Rust streaks caused by droppings from the track or by contact with hook bolt lips should not be mistaken for corrosion. primer is also damaged in patches, such patches should be painted with fresh zinc chromate primer before applying the finishing coat of aluminium. The finishing coats to be applied in shop and touched after erection, if necessary. 8.2.1 General i Slight slackness  i. ½ to IS 9954 i.e. near white metallic surface ii Painting a Primer coat Apply by brush airless spray two coats of epoxy zinc phosphate primer to RDSO specification No. M C PCN- 10286 to 60 microns minimum dry film thickness Loose rivets occur more frequently at certain locations especially where dynamic stresses, reversal of stresses and vibrations are at their maximum. Renewal of slack rivets should be done only when the slack rivet are in groups or are bunched up. The rivet head is held tightly against the member through a pneumaticallyhand-pressed dolly. The rivet shank is about 1.5 mm 157less than the diameter of the drilled hole. The normal working pressure of the compressed air should be between 5.6 and 7 kg per sq.cm. The rivet must be heated almost to a white heat and to a point when sparks are just beginning to fly off. While the rivet is hot, it must be driven straight keeping the hammer in straight position. The riveter must have his staging at a height which enables him to put the whole weight of his body behind the hammer. This prevents it from bouncing. The balance called live load camber should 158be available as visible and measurable camber in the girder when not carrying load. Loss of camber can be attributed to 1. Heavy overstressing of members beyond elastic limit 2. Overstressed of joint rivets 3. Play between rivet holes and rivet shanks because of faulty riveting. Cleaning and greasing of bearings is one of the important maintenance works to avoid premature failure of bearings and reduce recurring heavy repair cost. Steel bearing strip resting on steel base plate has a tendency to stick together on account of corrosion, and cease the movement of bearings. This is called as Frozen Bearing. Gap between bottom flange of plate girders and bed block generally varies from 100 mm to 150 mm. Standard jacks normally available have a closed height of at least 300 mm. Jacking arrangement for span 9.15 m plate girder requires provision of a hard wood beam below inner top. The provision of jacking steel beam and its removal is difficult. It requires more man power and also it is time-consuming. Field officials, many times, apply jack to the end cross frame angle diagonal to avoid provision of the jacking beam, to lift the girder. This may cause bending of the angle on account of its slender size, which results in lifting of bearing strips inside when lowered on base plate. Lifting of girder should be restricted to 8 to 10 mm only, ensuring that the bearing strip does not get lifted over locking strip and guide strip. Greasing of sliding bearings can be undertaken under traffic with issue of caution order and line protection for temporary works as per provision of IRPWM. The contact surlace is cleaned with oil and grease applied. Girder is then lowered back over the base plate. Time required for all these activities is approximately 15 to 20 minutes. In case of standard open web through girders, no separate jacking arrangement is required. Arried out under traffic block under the supervision of an official not below the rank of ADENABE. Following precautions and preliminary lifting of girder arrangements are required. Ensure tightness of rivets connecting end cross girder and end panel point of truss. During lifting of girder, precaution should be taken to prevent creep of rail. Greasing of fixed end requires 20 to 25 minutes. Jacks should be kept in working order and tested to 1.5 times the load they are expected to lift. Grease graphite grade 3 conforming to IS 508 is applied over the base plate evenly below the roller contact area. Link plate and tooth bars are connected with care so that tooth bar is placed in the same inclination as per the drawing. Details of each major important bridges AEN Para 1.5.

The objective of this research project has been to carry out an extensive filtering reconditioning of inspection data. The report does not constitute a standard, specification, regulation, product endorsement, or an endorsement of manufacturers. A computer program has been developed to calculate deterioration rates by Markov Chain and Weibull-based approaches. The computer program uses an updateable inspection database and generates quadratic equations of desired orders for deterioration rates. The main outcome of this project is a computer program for the calculation of deterioration rates. The computer program generates deterioration curves in the form of condition ratings versus age. These equations can be fed into the bridge management system such as PONTIS by the NYSDOT. This report describes the development of bridge element deterioration rates using the NYSDOT bridge inspection database using Markov chains and Weibull-based approaches. The outcome of the project will be implemented immediately by the NYS Department of Transportation and will continue to be used for many years in future. A computer program has been developed to generate deterioration curves and equations for bridge elements in New York State. Markov chains and Weibull-based approaches have been incorporated into a computer program that generates deterioration curves for specific bridge elements, based on historical NYSDOT bridge inspection data going back to 1981. Special thanks go to the members of the NYSDOT Technical Working Group and the Project Manager. The investigators will also like to express their gratitude to Dr. Sreenivas Alampalli of the New York State Department of Transportation and Dr. Mohammed Ettouney. The study is based on the state-of-the-art on determination of bridge deterioration rates. 3.

Deterioration of bridge elements occurs because of the combined effects of several complex effects. The deterioration of bridge Elements is described in the following sections. The sections are ordered by the type of bridge element. The condition assessment of the bridge infrastructure of New York State NYS is crucial in preparing five and ten-year capital programs for the construction and maintenance of bridges. More than 31 of bridges in the United States are considered deficient. A number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Indiana, developed their own BMS. This project is focused on element level deterioration versus overall bridge deterioration curves. Without an effective system to determine deterioration rates, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation MRR decisions will be seriously hampered. In the United States, condition ratings1 are used for standardized reporting of visual inspections of bridges. The New York State Departments ratings use ordinal, integer- values scales that indicate relative health of bridge elements. In accordance with New York State and Federal regulations NYSDOT 1997, components in all spans of the bridge are inspect. The overall Bridge Condition rating is computed by weighted average of the integer element condition ratings and is a function of selected weights. The bridge inspection program at the New York State Department of Transportation started in 1981. NYSDOT maintains an inventory of over 17,000 highway bridges across the state. These bridges are inspected biennially, or more often as necessary. Historical bridge inspection data can be used to develop models that can predict future bridge conditions and life-cycle predictions. The models can be updated and re-calibrated with the availability of new inspection data. Develop criteria to filter out erroneous or incompatible inspection data, classify filtered data according to climate and geographical location. Develop algorithms to calculate deterioration rates for classified bridge elements, major structural components and the overall bridge system. Develop a fully automated computer program based on Windows environment for determining the deterioration rates of individual bridge elements. AASHTO has prescribed a bridge-deterioration model as one of the minimum requirements of any BMS. By definition, a facility deterioration model links a measure of facility condition to a vector of explanatory variables. Explanatory variables, such as age, traffic, and weather, are defined as factors that affect facility deterioration.  models calculate the predicted conditions deterministically by ignoring the random error prediction and have several limitations. i they neglect the uncertainty due to inherent stochasticity of infrastructure deterioration and the existence of unobserved explanatory variables. ii they predict the average condition of a family of facilities regardless of the current condition and the condition history of individual facilities. Stochastic models treat the facility deterioration process as one or more random variables that capture the uncertainty and randomness of this process. Markovian models have been used extensively in modeling the deterioration rates of infrastructure facilities, e.g., pavement prediction model Butt et al 1987. Chase and Gaspar 2000 investigated load capacity of highway bridges with age using Markovian Decision Process. Their study is based on 409,741 bridges in the NBI database and the Hungarian Bridge Databank. Markovian models currently implemented in advanced BMS such as Pontis and BRIDGIT use the first-order Markovian Decision Process. They still suffer from the following limitations i they assume discrete transition time intervals, constant bridge population, and stationary transition probabilities, which are sometimes impractical. The most commonly used approach for the estimation of transition probabilities is the linear regression method Carnahan et al. 1987. Despite several limitations of the Markov process described above, it is the most widely used.  linear regression based approach fails to capture the deterioration process because the change in condition within an inspection period is not explicitly modeled. Madanat and Ibrahim 1995 proposed a solution to these problems by calculating transition probabilities by Poisson regression model or negative binomial model. In order to model deterioration behavior of structures more realistically, several researchers have proposed to combine probabilistic models e.g. Markov chain approach and mechanistic models. For the calculation of deterioration rates using the NYSDOT inspection data, the authors have chosen to use both Markov chains and Weibull based approaches."

        "response": "Based on detailed discussions with NYSDOT, elements shown in Table 1-2 below have been included in the computer program to calculate deterioration rates. Superstructure Recommendation a rating of the entire system comprising of Superst Structure Elements to best describe the inspectors opinion of systems condition and ability to function is also included. Bridge elements shown in Table 1-2 above are identified from different Tables in NYSDOTs Bridge Inventory Database. During the calculation of deterioration rates, inspection data for a particular element should only be taken for the span number listed in table 1-3. Span Number is critical, as RC15 has an inventory record for each span of each bridge. The span number used for the inventory data needs to be the same as the span number for the inspection data for the corresponding element. Using bridge inventory information described in Table 1-3 above, elements are analyzed as both as a whole and subgroups within the element. The program matches the span number in the inventory database to that in the historical inspection database to retrieve element condition ratings for a further analysis.

NYSDOT provided a database containing B-history bridge history, S-history span history inspection data, and inventory data tables for the calculation of deterioration rates. Extensive data filtering has been done on the inspection data and bridge inventory information provided by NYSDOT. In addition to this, reconditioning of inspection data has been carried out based Most bridges in New York State are only inspected every two years. Inspection ratings for elements during intermediate years between two consecutive inspection cycles are set to values corresponding to those of the proceeding year. If the bridge was built within a few years prior to when the NYSDOT bridge inspection program began in 1981, all ratings from the year built to the year of nonzero rating is set to 7. 2.2. Estimation of the correct age of bridge elements is necessary for the development of realistic 15deterioration curves. In case of bridges with elements reconstructed after the original bridge built date, the year of bridge element reconstruction must be known. Inspection data were analyzed to identify bridge elements with two point improvements in ratings over consecutive inspections. This would indicate significant rehabilitation work. If the rating was a two point improvement to a 7, the element was likely replaced. All data before the improvement were discarded. These element data where not included as we were interested in the development of deterioratio. The above filtering criteria cannot identify elements that were rehabilitated before the NYSDOT bridge inspection started in 1981. Additional rules have been implemented to identify possible rehabilitation in such cases. Extensive algorithms have been developed to identify such situations and to recondition identified data. The two ratings of 6 are likely due to only one inspection cycle, since most bridges are only inspected every two years. The data is modified to be condition rating 5 for 14 years. This modification is designed to minimize the effects of rater subjectivity. NYSDOT maintains an element work history in BHISTORY and SHISTORY databases. Information about element built year can also be derived from these databases. A filter was developed to identify if the condition rating was 7 at element rebuild year. Inclusion of very old bridges in the deterioration rate calculations can introduce serious bias in the results. For example, several elements of bridges built in 1950s are likely to be replaced before the inspection started in 1981. In order to partially address this issue, a limit of maximum number of years in a rating was imposed on the inspection data. These restrictions were imposed on structural decks through a simple filtering logic. Based on these calculations, it was determined that bridge decks can stay up to 35 years in rating 7 and 50 years in ratings 6. The impact of some of the biases introduced because of bridge element reconstruction before the start of bridge inspection in 1981 can be minimized by imposing further restrictions on some elements. These restrictions are described for various elements in the following. Eliminates or modify data based on composite decks not used prior to 1942. If built before 1890, eliminate data for abutment joint type 04 Finger type or joint type 07 Preformed Elastomeric Seals. Eliminate data for abutment joint types 15 to 18 or joint types 29 to joint type 34 i.e., all strip seal joints. If bridge built before 1968 and has weathering steel primary members, then primary member has been rebuilt after 1968. Use of pre-stressed concrete primary member started after 1955. Figure 2-3 shows the deterioration curve for structural deck using unfiltered data. It is observed that the structural deck condition ratings start increasing after the age of 50 years. This is because of bias introduced into the data. Figure 2-4 shows deterioration curves generated by Markov and Weibull approaches. It is observed that the filteringreconditioning has effectively eliminated the effects of bias. Condition ratings beyond the age of 60 years are seen to be decreasing with age. The deterioration processes of bridge elements may depend on factors related to geographic locations, climatic conditions, traffic loads, material type of the bridge, etc. It is advantageous to classify all bridges based on available information so that we can apply the deterioration model on group of bridges with similar characteristic to achieve reasonable and accurate deterioration rates. A cascading algorithm has been developed so that bridges can be classified by considering a combination of any number of factors. A brief description of various factors for classification of bridges is presented in the following."

Although there are 40 different types of ownerships, they can be combined into groups of 8 ownership as shown in Table 3-1. Table 3-1 also shows number of bridges by ownership groups. Ownership Type Classification Based on Primary Ownership. Superstructure Design Type All bridges can be classified by 18 superstructure design types as shown in Table 1-19. Climate data for New York State have been obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA. Historic data are available from year 1895 to 2002. Temperature, Precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index are used. Data are presented as year-month time series for each of the ten climate divisions. Rigorous statistical classification procedures are employed for the classification of climate according to conditions expressible in numerical measurements. K-Mean Clustering and Hierarchical Classification algorithms have been considered. We choose the former algorithm for its overall simplicity and performance. All three categories of available data are joined together for each region and each year. K- Mean clustering algorithm is applied on available data over all years. The running average of each cluster is used during the iteration for formation of clusters. The algorithm is configured to form 5 clusters. Figures 3-3 show that region 4 belongs to Cluster 1 since region 4 has largest bubble corresponding to cluster 1. Majority data points for region 9 and 10 are classified into cluster 5. Region 1, 2, and 6 have more dataclassified into cluster 2 than those classified into either cluster 4 or 5.

Bridge distribution in the 10 NOAA regions. NOAA region boundaries are shown as connected blue lines while bridges are dots of different colors. These bridges can be further classified into five clusters or weather classes. If a new bridge is included in the database, it can be classified in one of the five clusters. Since parkways are not allowed to have any truck traffic, parkway bridges have been classified into the class with AADTT 0.8. All bridges in New York State can be classified by five functional classes carried by the bridges. Information for the functional class carried is derived from the Functional Classification field of RC12. All bridges in New York State can be classified into Interstate Under, Highway Under and Water Under categories using the information in Subsets Table. Snow accumulation data were obtained from NYSDOT for each county for a relatively short period spanning 1995 to 2003. Bridges located in each county are assigned to the same class as the county. No snow accumulation data was documented for NYSDOT region N NYC. Erie County is substantially greater than any other counties, it is assigned to a cluster cluster 4 by itself. Each bridge was assigned to the same salt usage class as the county it belongs to. Since no salt usage data were available for the 5 counties of NYC NYSDOT region N, the bridges of these counties were not assigned to any of the 4 clusters. Individual membership of a county to a particular cluster is shown in Table 3-9. Table 3-8 Bridge Distribution Across Salt Usage Classes.

Classification can be done by Present Wearing Surface on the basis of 17 wearing surface types in Table 1-18. Structural decks can also be classified on the based of Original Wearing. Surface into classes shown in Table 3-10 below. Cascading classification can be done by selecting an element and various factors to be considered for classification. For example, Abutment Bearing element has 6 design types. Since the cascading is dynamic, any number of factors can be selected for cascading. Deterministic approaches are based on statistical and non-linear regression analysis of data to determine deterioration rates. Some of the common deterministic methods to calculate deterioration rates are i Average ΔT for Transition of States Curves, ii Average of Ratings Curves and iv Ordinary Least Square Approach. In stochastic approaches, bridge element ratings or duration at a particular rating are assumed to be random variables and are modeled by an underlying probability distribution. The ordinary least square approach to can used to obtain condition rating as a function of different factors affecting bridge element deterioration. Bridge deterioration process depends on many factors, such as Average Annual Daily Truck Traffic AADTT, climate, maintenance level, etc. Although deterministic models have been used to calculate deterioration rates, stochastic models are inherently capable of accounting for the uncertainty and randomness factors. We have selected both Markov chains and Weibull-based approach to calculate deterioration rates using NYSDOT bridge inspection data. These two methods have been programmed into a computer program developed for the calculation of deterioration rates. Markovian models address the uncertainty of the deterioration process and account for the current facility condition in predicting the future one. They still suffer from several limitations such as i they assume discrete transition time intervals, constant bridge population, and stationary transition probabilities. The Markov chains process is the most widely used approach for deterioration modeling. For the NYSDOT bridge inspection system, seven bridge condition ratings from 7 to 1 can be defined as seven Markovian states. Without repair or rehabilitation, the bridge condition rating should decrease with increase in bridge age. There is a probability, p , of a bridge element transiting from one ij condition state, say i, to another state, j, between inspections. The probability of state i not transitioning to state j is then 1- p . The lowest rating possible is 1. The deterioration rate at any age can be defined as the slope of the condition rating curve in Eq.4-3. The transition t 0 probability matrix P in E. g 6 34State 2 can be used to estimate condition rating R as a function of time. Non-homogeneity of the continuous deterioration process is captured indirectly through segmentation of bridge elements into age groups. Within each group, Markov Chains are assumed to be homogeneous. A new bridge element is almost always given a condition rating of 7. The transition matrix P in Eq.4-1 is determined using nonlinear programming. The starting state vector Q is used to determine R for 10 to 20 years 10 P,t interval using P matrix for this age group. This process is followed until R is generated for the P,.t entire age range of interest. Data generated by Markov Chains processes using 10-year age groups are used as original data Yt in Eq.4-4 to derive one transition matrix for the age group from 0 to 40 years. Markov chains data generated by this transition matrix will follow the dominant deteriorating behavior during the first 40 years of data. T ,i 7, 6, ..1, which represents the duration in number of years i that an element stays in a particular condition rating, is a random variable modeled by a Weibull distribution. The probability PT t that T exceeds t years is called survival function of T and is i i i denoted by, S t etηiβi ,t 0, β 0, η 0, i 7,6, 5, .., 1.  Distributions of durational phenomena at a particular rating are typically skewed and 36consequently are rarely normally distributed. Figure 4-2 shows the frequency distribution of durations at different condition ratings for structural decks. The most frequently used distributions for such data are the Weibull and lognormal. Analysis of reconditioned inspection data of most of the bridge elements in New York State during preliminary analysis of the work presented in this report. Weibull distribution parameters β and η,i 1, 2, ..6, obtained by fitting duration data for I i different condition ratings can be used to estimate any other distributional characteristic. The probability that a structural deck that has been at CR6 for 10 years will move to CR5 within the next 10 years is 1-0.68. This type of information is extremely important for effective bridge management and cannot be obtained by other approaches, including the Markov chains approach. Some elements will transition to i-1th CR during this period. This information can be calculated by percentile of CR, given by1β t ηln1 p 4-7."

Table3 shows the bridges that belong to the class but do not have conditional rating data. Element View lists all bridge elements. A specific element can be selected by double clicking by the mouse. All element rating data in the handled table will be displaced in the right side window. Weibull-based approach generally gives higher deterioration rate than that by Markov Chains. It is observed from Fig. 4-20a using Markov chains that plate girders made of weathering steel deteriorate slower than those made of steel from the beginning. Beyond 20 years of age, weathering steel plate girders deteriorate slower. Weathering steel bridges form the protective rust patina that forms during the early years, resulting in a decrease in deterioration.  eibull- based approach is almost identical during the first 20 years. Censoring takes place when the duration at a specific condition level is not completely observed. This happens for the latest condition rating on file or when the condition rating of a bridge element is improved. In Markov Chains, there are only two choices regarding censored observation disregard them or treat them as actual durations. Weibull distribution-based approach can handle censored data by explicitly considering duration dependency in the analysis. Figures 4-21a and 4- 21b show deterioration plots for structural decks with coated and uncoated rebars in bridges owned by NYSDOT using Markov chains and Weibull-based approaches, respectively. Durations for condition ratings to drop from 7 to 4 are 49 and 62 years by Markov Chains approach. These durations are 43 and 60 years, Fig. 4-21 shows plots for structural decks with coated and uncoated rebars in bridges owned by NYSDOT and by locally agencies. It is observed that decks of locally owned bridges deteriorate slightly faster than those owned by New York State Department of Transportation. Higher rate of deterioration in locally owned bridge decks may be because of several factors. Figure 4-22 shows deterioration plots for structural decks with uncoated rebars. Using Markov chains approach, b Weibull-based approach. It is observed from Fig. 4-23 that pier caps deteriorate to condition ratings 6, 5 and 4 in 18, 34 and 54 years. Deterioration plots for concrete pier caps in bridges owned by NYSDOT. Abutment bearings deteriorate from condition rating 7 to condition ratings 6, 5 and 4 in 17, 36 and 58 years, respectively. Deterioration rates for both types of materials are almost the same during the first 9 years using Markov chains and during theFirst 30 years using the Weibull-based approach. Different behavior of plots by Markov. chains than those of WeibULL-based. approach is because of segmentation of data in 10 years groups to derive the first level Markov Chains. Weibull-based approach is more reliable than Markov chains approach. Markov chain method simply carries out curve fitting to average condition rating data. Weibull approach takes into account scatter in the data at a particular age. Further study of deterioration rates for various bridge elements has been carried out using the WeibULL- based approach.

These bridges are inspected biennially, or more often as necessary. Bridge inspectors are required to assign a condition rating for up to 47 structural elements of each bridge. Cascading approach generates classes of bridges based on classification factors selected. These classes can be analyzed to calculate deterioration rates. Various algorithm have been developed to correct element rebuilt year information if the element has been rebuilt. Markov Chain and Weibull-based approaches have been used to develop the computer program for deterioration rate calculations. The computer program uses an updateable inspection database and generates polynomial equations of desired orders for deterioration rates. Better Roads, November 1997.

Mistry Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Reinforcing to Extend the Fatigue Lives of Existing Steel Bridges The authors of this article have published a number of articles on the subject of bridge management. The articles are divided into three sections. The first section is titled \"Bridge Management in Transportation Agencies\" The German Approach to Bridge Management Current Status and Future Development PETER HAARDT RALPH HOLST Federal Highway Research Institute Germanys road infrastructure grew over centuries to become the arteries and lifelines of our society. There is a strong need for management solutions during the whole service life of a structure. The definition of criteria for evaluation of the relevance of failure mechanisms, including acceptance thresholds, requires the availability of relevant data for management procedure. A high-quality road infrastructure is a fundamental precondition for an industrial society. Road infrastructure is not exclusively technical by nature it also has social, political, and ecological dimensions. As Europe grows economically and culturally closer together, the road infrastructure will come under greater pressure. Life-cycle-oriented road infrastructure management is indispensable in Germany. The federal road network carries the main load of the transit traffic by reason of its central position in Europe. It will have to take increasing traffic loads in future due to the further development of the European market. There are currently 37,817 bridges with a total length of 1,963 km. Most of them are prestressed concrete bridges around 70 years old. Despite the planned lifespan of more than 70 years, scores of bridges show major damages after a time period of 30 to 40 years.  maintenance needs today are in the range of 1 of the fixed assets, which represents about 500 million per year. The maintenance programs prepared for this purpose not only require a high budget, but also influence the traffic infrastructure and society as a whole. Systematic bridge maintenance should be understood as a process. A simplified flow chart of the tasks to be carried out in the context of systematic bridge maintenance is shown in Figure 2. Starting from bridge stock and condition data resulting from regular bridge inspections damage analyses and deterioration forecasts can be made. After checking of possible maintenance strategies a priority ranking is a priority. Main inspections are regularly carried out every 6 years simple inspections are to be carried out 3 years after a main i. s well as a program formation and provision of the required financial means are carried out. Main inspections are executed as visual inspections with a hand near examination of the complete structure. Some field tests for deeper examination are frequently undertaken using special nondestructive testing NDT equipment. Results of the inspection are collected in the database SIB-Bauwerke Road Information DatabaseStructures. The databases set up according RI-EBW- PRÜF contain extensive information about the different structures. From this information a condition index is derived in the range of 1.0 very good condition to 4.0 insufficient condition. Figure 3 shows the current distribution of condition index for structures in the federal road network. Haardt and Holst 7 to a more precise assessment of size and cause of damage. Because of compatibility demands on the German BMS, a standardized procedure for special investigations and a guideline of object-related damage analysis were developed 7.  monitoring is a promising method to achieve additional information about the time- dependent structural behavior of bridges. Currently it is applied if common inspection procedures are not effectual. The progress in development of sensors and other equipment enables monitoring applications to obtain high- quality results. The BMS is a comprehensive management system for structural maintenance. It is developed as a tool for all stakeholders of road administrations and federal institutions. It provides state authorities with draft maintenance plans required to obtain improvements. The module proposes technically reasonable measures for every8 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference. Measures and measure combinations are considered for a period of 6 years. BMS-EP maintenance program for optimization of maintenance planning on the network level and presentation of maintenance programs. This module is responsible for choosing the best combination of measures maintenance strategies for each year of the planning period. The module may also be used to determine the necessary yearly budget to achieve a desired quality level in the network quality scenario. At the federal level information from the BISStra Federal Road Information System database is considered. The road infrastructure network is of vital importance for the society and economy as a whole. Growing traffic demand is linked to more standardized technical and legal requirements. The transport systems in Europe will be more and more harmonized. There is need for a more holistic approach integrating the best practices across Europe. Most developed countries are facing a continuously growing maintenance backlog. Not all negative impacts on safety and security can be mastered or are already identified. Current road infrastructure has to be converted to be fit for the future. Heavy goods traffic will increase by about 84 up to the year 2025. Pressure from the transport industry to introduce modular vehicle concepts that could reach a maximum weight of 60 tons. Figure 5 shows the distribution of bridge classes according to the outdated DIN 1072 for the federal road network. Analytical investigations by traffic simulation showed that most of the older bridges have structural deficiencies and should be strengthened. This would result in costs of more than 1 billion. Strengthening of bridges is expected to be an outstanding task of the near future. The replacement of older bridges by sufficiently designed ones could be an efficient strategy in particular cases. Haardt and Holst 11 NDT for Efficient and Sustainable Management of Structures. The expert system aims at Improved information on loads and resistance of existing concrete structures and implementable strengthening methods. Current NDT investigations on structures are still time consuming and may lead to considerable disturbances of the traffic. To speed up inspections automatic and scanning NDT methods are badly needed. Against the background of the aging bridge stock and decreasing maintenance funds, optimized maintenance planning gains in importance. NDT methods have the advantage to detect potential damages at an early stage. Then adequate measures could be induced before severe damages occur. NDT measurements could be included here for contribution of relevant parameters. This could also form a robust basis for infrastructure planning. The experiences from current practice of maintenance management in Germany show that in terms of being fit for the future there are still open questions in the field of maintenance planning. Enhancement of data qualityquality assurance, Further development of deterioration models, Development of models to describe the extent of damage and deterioration, Coordinated maintenance planning, and Enhancement of the BMS for other BASt developed queries to increase the quality of the SIB-Bauwerke database. These queries will help to find out data inconsistencies. Further steps will be the enhancement of data quality as part of the training course for bridge inspectors. The models depend on personal experiences and in fact do not always produce comprehensible results. Experiences diverge with regard to the lifespan of bearings and expansion joints. In future the based on experience type of models will be replaced by probabilistic approaches.  e BMS allows for an application at a personnel computer or server. Future versions are to be complemented for an applications on the web. At present there is no unique model to maintain the road in total with one management system. The German BMS takes bridges into consideration as the most important part of the engineering structures of the federal highways. But there are even other engineering structures that have to be maintained and that show a high economical value tunnel, noise barriers, signpost bridges, and retaining walls. Risk management will play an increasing role for road tunnels as fire disasters in tunnels have shown in past decades. There is a strong need for road infrastructure to be fit for the future. The requirement to manage maintenance effectively is becoming more pressing. The relevant criterion for bridge management in Germany is not only the condition index but also load-bearing capacity. There is a need for sophisticated methods to find structural problems before severe damages occur without hindrance of traffic flow.

Pontis has received wide acceptance by state departments of transportation DOTs. According to surveys conducted by FHWA, 39 states have subscribed to the software. Some states are using Pontis simply as a place to store inventory data. Oregon has maintained bridge inspection condition information at the element level in Pontis since 1993. In 1999, Oregons project selection method integrating inspection data from Pontis with other bridge condition dataspecifically nondeterioration-based needs. Data outside of Pontis were used to select problem bridges.  ODOT's efforts to implement Pontis through development of the deterioration and cost models was derailed for a period of about 5 years due to reaction to shear cracking in reinforced concrete deck girder bridges. Beginning in 2006, ODOT resumed efforts to implemented Pontis. This report outlines practical aspects of progress and challenges in implementing Pontis while attempting to maintain the comprehensive nature of Pontis bridge management software has promising analytical and project decision support capabilities. Yet, according to recent 2006 surveys, very few, if any, states are using Pontis in a way that matches up with early expectations for the tool. This paper reports on the Oregon experience with Pontis implementation. Oregon DOT ODOT had obtained a license for Pontis soon after beta versions of the software became available in the early 1990s. In 1994, Oregon began to use Pontis to record bridge inspection data based on the Commonly Recognized CoRe structural elements. By 1995, ODOT, with the support of the FHWA Oregon Division, initiated a bridge Project selection process was used by ODOT to develop the 19982001, the 2000 2003 Table 2 and the 20042007 STIP. The same data and analysis methods were used to develop a 20-year needs study for bridges in the 1999 Oregon Highway Plan. 18 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference. ODOT Categories for Bridge Projects Category Data Collections Involved Selection Criteria Level of service Inventory, load rating Weight capacity, legal, and permit loads. In March 2001 a bridge on Interstate 5 was closed for emergency repairs, resulting in a detour through the main streets of two small southern Oregon towns. Concerns were raised regarding safety, infrastructure damage to local facilities, and a negative effect on commerce in the region. The problem was seen as a symptom of a much larger problem than the one bridge and two communities. The old project selection process, data driven and geographically blind, became known as the worst first approach. ODOT created a Bridge Strategy Task Force. The Task Force sought to explain the emergence of the cracked concrete bridges and identified strategies to address them. Report identified 365 cracked girder bridges in need of repair or replacement. Highway User Tax Bonds in the amount of 1.3 billion to be issued to address the problem. Project selection process was overshadowed by new developments. The project selection process for both OTIA and the 20062009 STIP was corridor based, but focusing primarily on load capacity. During the time frame of the development of the 2006 2009 STIP, ODOT reorganized the structure of the department. Bridge design functions were moved from the headquarters unit to the regional offices. Oregon is facing an aging transportation infrastructure. The Bridge Section returned its focus to Pontis implementation efforts. Six priorities that became key initiatives emerged during the planning process 4 Maintaining and maximizing the assets in place Optimizing the performance of the existing system through technology.  ODOT is in the early stages of implementing a comprehensive asset management program. Once the asset management system becomes more robust, its data and information will be key in framing legislative dialogues regarding the nature and extent of transportation issues. e in ODOT is largely integrated vertically and horizontally. All program areas are included and represented in executive, steering, and technical committees. The Oregon Transportation Commission OTC is currently engaged in a discussion of multimodal tradeoff analysis. A number of agencies report that they do conduct comparative analysis within modes or programs to inform project selection and funding decisions. These processes often involve tools such as economic analysis, pavement and BMS, and traditional travel demand models.  ODOT is clearly a leader among states in terms of its investment in and refinement of the types of analytical tools, processes, and staff resources that would be required to more fully implement a multimodal tradeoff process. Oregon has been evaluating Asset Manager NT and PT software. The ability of software such as Asset Manager NT to produce valuable results depends on the quality of the results generated from the input systems. A 1999 paper by Edgar Small, Terry Philbin, Michael Fraher, and George Romack of FHWA recounts the history of the development of BMS. Pontis employed a top-down approach while BRIDGIT followed a bottom-up approach. The authors report that as of May 1998, there were 45 subscribers to Pontis, including 38 state DOTs. In 1995, the National Highway System Designation Act Public Law 104-59 officially repealed the legislative requirements for BMS implementation. 26 states are currently using Pontis for decision support for one or more business processes. 40 states currently consider themselves to be Pontis states, and four more are evaluating Pontis. Less than 10 states are using Pontis for project scheduling, priority setting, and budgeting. Why is it taking so long to fully implement Pontis? The nature of the elicitation process is best guess based on experience. Results are as good as your guesses, and without such a knowledgeable resource, the guesses may not be very good. Insufficient past data on actual deterioration rates have been recorded in Pontis to be a usefu. Pontis does have an option to use historical data to create deterioration models. To be really useful, a long set of inspection records from many years are needed for each element in each environment and condition state. For no element do we have enough data for a complete set of elementenvironment condition state observations. The absence of good repair records provides an additional complication. Without knowing what repair has been done to a bridge and when the repair was completed, there is no way of knowing if an element in good condition on an old bridge is due to a low deterioration rate or the result of a past repair. Pontis uses feasible actions as the repair actions it can perform in a simulation. ODOT uses the feasible actions set out in the AASHTO Guide for Commonly Recognized CoRe Structural Elements. Costs for the element-level MRR actions was nonexistent at ODOT. The Bridge Section has collected construction cost data, based on bid items and quantities included in construction contracts. These bid items have no direct linkage to MRR action costs. The tracking of bridge maintenance expenditures in the ODOT accounting system is both unrelated and unfriendly to extracting the actual data needed on an ongoing basis. With a relatively small number of bridge projects bid each year, the possibility of skewing of average cost data is sizable. Mach and Hartman 25: Cost data had not yet met the red-face test of whether it reflects something close enough to reality to be used to develop high-level needs cost data. It became obvious that our costs were not well documented and while most met the that looks about right test, those that did not could not be defended. Work session 2 was devoted to developing and testing initial simulation scenarios. We were successful in testing several simulation rules and running simulations to identify improvement recommendations. At this point, we can get results, but it is still too soon to know if they are results we can trust. Pontis MRR model allowed our bridges to deteriorate to a degree with which we were uncomfortable. AASHTO has modified Pontis by adding agency rules to address this issue. Agency rules can be defined to override the MRr model if it is necessary. The MRR model is run prior to a simulation and so is independent of the simulation. The simulation model uses the deterioration elicitations to determine the condition state of each element in each year. It uses the results to determine what action to recommend for each element depending on its condition state. The MRR model must be adjusted until it reflects agency practice. To accomplish this, a simulation is run for each element, one at a time. If the time to the first repair is not consistent with agency experience, the time period to the repair is adjusted. Pontis will only replace a bridge for functional reasons, although it will allow a bridge replacem. We remain optimistic that after the deterioration elicitation for all nearly 150 elements has been adjusted and any necessary rules written, Pontis will model MRR repairs correctly. The model implies that bridges can be maintained indefinitely and do not have a life expectancy that should only be exceeded cautiously. Creative methods of addressing other bridge needs such as scour, seismic retrofitting, substandard bridge rail, insufficient permit load capacity, or collision damage will need to be developed. System health over time is a network-level issue that Pontis excels at. Ensuring that the user costs and benefits calculations in Pontis make use of the best information available will also be as critical as good project cost information.  asset management and project selection are not the same thing. Asset management can be looked upon as strategy and STIP project selection as tactics. Once we have the models set up, Pontis should be able to do a good job of predicting the condition of specific bridges. The Pontis MRR model is inflexible in the sense that it cannot easily be set up to select a particular repair when an element reaches a given condition state. The models are difficult and time-consuming to set up. Staffing commitment must be full-time, consistent and long-term. Pontis software may find the Pontis software challenging to fully implement. We have suffered from the absence of a full-time, consistent, and long-term staffing and management commitment to implementation. We lack agreement on performance measures and the data needed to measure them. We find the best use of funding based on engineering judgment may not directly influence performance measures. We are unwilling to trust long-range planning or budgeting results at the network level until we can verify that we can use Pontis to correctly identify the highest priority needs. Pontis users are attempting to improve both the quality of the quantitative data and the analytical software. This is in service of systematic decision-making processes to improve the condition of the nations bridge inventory. thors acknowledge all Pontis users. Most state departments of transportation employ a bridge management system BMS. The objective of this study has been to gather information on how bridge management information is used for agency decision making on bridge investments and resource allocation. Bridge management information is used in resource allocation decisions in all transportation agencies that were included in this study. Some agencies apply bridge management techniques that are at the state of the art, but the majority appear to use only a subset of existing BMS capabilities. B ridges are critical and highly visible components of a transportation system. Designing, building, maintaining, repairing, and replacing bridges involve significant investment decisions. Agencies try to get these investments right to minimize life-cycle cost and to provide safe and efficient mobility to transportation system users. This paper summarizes the key findings to date of this study. Bridge management in the United States has advanced considerably in the past 40 years. The National Bridge Inspection Standards NBIS were implemented in the 1970s. Bridge structural deficiency SD and functional obsolescence FO, two ratings that the NBIS defined, became key performance measures. While some revisions to NBIS have occurred, the definition and application of these bridge ratings have remained essentially unchanged for more than 30 years. The SD and SR ratings are somewhat inconsistent with respect to bridge decks. While SD directly reflects a deck condition that is poor or worse, the SR is much less sensitive. Since SR is one of the criteria of project eligibility for federal highway bridge program funding, this inconsistency can create problems. The NBI ratings play a significant role in apportioning federal bridge program funds to states. The NBI is the primary data source for the disbursement of funds through HBRRP Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. NBI conditionperformance ratings are aggregate measures. This form of bridge management based on NBI data utilizes aggregated information. While the formula is convenient for funds allocation, it is not necessarily sufficient for analysis and needs prediction. Today all state DOTs have a bridge management process. Most also employ some type of automated BMS with an associated database of bridge-related information. This database typically includes NBIS data and ratings, but often incorporates additional, more detailed, or customized data. Pontis is a full-featured BMS in use in more than 40 state DOTs and several other city, county, and international agencies. NBI data are included for annual reporting to FHWA, and additional, custom data defined by the agency are likewise included. 32 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference Needs assessment and strategy development estimate and update bridge element deterioration and treatment cost models. develop long- range, network-level policies for both structure preservation and bridge improvement. Pontis analytic processes are extensive and address several aspects of bridge management. These procedures can be applied in functions such as needs estimates, identification of recommended programs subject to budget constraints. Pontis also has features dedicated to incorporating user-defined additions or revisions within its analytic framework and graphical user display. The reports are organized by system modules including Bridge Inspection, Bridge Preservation Needs and Projected Work, and Bridge Projects. Previous studies have looked at topics similar to the subject of this paper. The following points summarize these previous studies to help establish context for the current effort. More detailed discussions of these studies will be presented in the study final report. BMS was used by about 70 of responding agencies for developing program goals, identifying projects, and setting priorities. Prioritization methods for bridge programs used technical measures of sufficiency or deficiency much more than economic or other types of measures. Only four of the 26 surveyed agencies used their BMS for statewide transportation improvement program STIP development and Agencies varied in their project-level planning and programming practices. A review of the status of Pontis implementation in 2002 indicated that Half of the Pontis users surveyed applied the system solely to input and manage bridge inspection data. Interviews with 10 agencies, most of which had bridge management systems, indicated the following as of 2002. Many of these agencies used their BMS albeit to varying degrees to support project prioritization and budgetperformance trade-offs within individual program categories Only one agency had attempted cross-program trade-off analyses. Bridge management information is used in program-level decision making in all transportation agencies that reported in this study. The specific management practices, analytic models, and performance measures differ among agencies, in some cases significantly. The role of bridge management in agency functions such as planning, programming, and resource allocation can be better understood when the characteristics of different BMS are considered. BMS vary in analytic capabilities and sophistication, as observed earlier. Full- featured systems operate both at the program level and at the level of individual bridges or projects. BMS results are for near-term rather than long-term analysis horizons. Recommended actions focus on a single strategy rather than a comparative analysis of several options or scenarios. Calculated costs are solely those attributed to the agency rather than i. The gap that exists between the state of the art versus the general state of practice of bridge management systems has persisted for more than 10 years. The capabilities of BMS products are under- utilized. Costs are calculated for near-term budgets rather than for the bridge life cycle. The benefits of different network investment strategies, to evaluate long-term as well as near-term needs, are used by only a relatively small subset of DOTs. Despite this underutilization, the ability to tailor bridge management practices and system outputs to individual agency needs helps to strengthen the relevance of bridge-related information to agency decision making. Agencies differ in their reliance on bridge management systems for decision making. Those that believe in making full use of the available features of a BMS use tools such as scenario analyses. Long-term, however, they may not send correct signals regarding needed updating of bridge priorities. Customized performance measures such as deficiency-point calculations and custom bridge condition and health indexes were felt to be critical to advancing state-specific practices technically, managerially, and procedurally. Customized bridge rating indexes were also seen by some agencies as a way to get better information. Some senior bridge managers have asked their personnel to consider broader implications of different bridge investments. Examples of how bridge management information is reportedly now applied to particular types of agency processes and decisions are described in the following sections. Many agencies track progress toward objectives and targets somewhat informally, especially by looking at general trends rather than firm thresholds and schedules of accomplishment. The field is in flux a number of agencies that were interviewed in the study described new, improved measures of system condition and performance that were under development. The use of bridge management systems to quantify performance measures and targets is shown in Figure 1. Almost all respondents indicated that their BMS is used to calculate current bridge condition or performance directly. More than half of the respondents reported using their B MS for plannin.

Safety and other potentially serious catastrophic problems Statewide and district level condition or health index PERFORMANCE Bridge performance information to compare against targets. The greatest reported use is for items that are of immediate interest and most direct and unambiguous in their scope. Use of BMS results declines as the focus of this information extends to longer planning horizons. BMS applications to resource allocation and trade-off analyses are reported by 60 to 70 of respondents. In many of these cases the BMS information is supplemented by additional analytic processing or subjective judgment. S of investment, was reported much less frequently and, where it is performed, is rarely accomplished using the BMS alone. The reasons for these results may include one or more of the following a preferences by different managers vary on what categories or formats of information to display b models and data that are needed to compute these impacts are not now part of the agencys BMS c data or Two trends that are now under way may influence the way in which bridge management information is applied to agency decision making in the future. One trend is the growing application of information for programming and budgeting.  Asset management has already enjoyed successes in agencies abilities to improve notably transportation system condition. Successful asset management processes have enabled agencies to transition from a worst-first approach to one based upon long-term cost effectiveness, employing life-cycle-cost principles. BMS helps in resource allocation among bridges statewide. BMS produces reports for budgeting by all organizational unitslevels that manage bridges. Project-level dashboard shows impacts of bridge work or deferral. Current policy direction and objectives of the bridge program are often informally stated and loosely tracked. Monitoring of accomplishments is often based on looking at general trends. The process lacks specific time frames and stated levels of accomplishment. Several elements of current bridge program management are inconsistent with one another, and detract from more effective agency decisions and uses of available funding. These inconsistencies derive primarily from the different ways of thinking that underlie the formulation of the NBIS versus more recent bridge management concepts and techniques.  NBIS inventory data, ratings, and appraisals continue to be an important influence on perceptions of bridge condition and performance. This situation may change with the complete review of the NBIS by the U.S. DOT Inspector General that was ordered by the Secretary of Transportation. The NBI database serves several important functions. It is unequaled as the most comprehensive, up-to-date, unified source of bridge information nationwide. stimony by state DOT CEOs and other senior managers some representing AASHTO. NBIS is inconsistent with the current state of bridge management. State DOTs have recognized this shortcoming of NBIS for some time. Agency managers have adapted their bridge management processes and systems to compensate for certain weaknesses. State DOT executives, appearing before U.S. House and Senate committees, outlined several issues with the current NBIS. The 10-year rule that inhibits more economically efficient preventive maintenance strategies. The review of the NBIS was just begun as the material for this paper was being prepared, so no definitive information or results were available to include in this paper. Most state DOTs employ some type of bridge management system to assist, at a minimum, in monitoring bridge condition. Bridge management information is used in resource allocation decision making in all transportation agencies reporting in this study. While a common element among virtually all DOT BMS processes is information on bridge inventory and condition appraisal, BMS approaches vary widely in how they support other management functions. T of BMS applications nationwide is toward relatively straightforward analyses of short-term bridge needs based on current condition and performance. More comprehensive or longer-term analyses are reserved for major bridge projects, or are the purview of those agencies. Bridge management practices reportedly serve upper management acceptably given current procedures for federal bridge program funding and administration. Two emerging trends may influence how bridge information and management techniques may inform agency decisions in the future. The author takes responsibility for the statements that assess their implications and the resulting conclusions.

Testimony of the Director and Chief Executive Officer, Michigan Department of Transportation, before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives. Washington, D.C., September 5, 2007. KUBA 4.0 is a comprehensive road structure management system developed for the Swiss Federal Roads Authority. KUBA is similar to other state-of-the-art management systems but has numerous distinctive characteristics. The aging infrastructure on one hand, and increasing traffic on the other, require ever more funds to maintain current levels of service to road users. Under permanent pressure to cut spending, the road authorities must develop ways to increase the efficiency of available resources. There are currently around 6,700 road structures, including ca. 3,500 bridges. The total bridge surface area amounts to ca. 4 million m2. In its final stage the national road network will comprise about 4,000 b. Major part of the current road structures has already reached an age of 30 years. The condition development of bridges based on regular inspections is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 only considers bridges that were put in service before December 31, 2006. The number of bridges in the worst CS is negligible. This indicates that the current maintenance strategy is sufficiently funded. The condition profile of road structures on the national road network is likely to remain stable. The purpose of road infrastructure is to ensure fast and safe passage between any two points on the road network. There is an increasing pressure to reduce public funds for transportation infrastructure in general. The goals of users are already stated they are interested in fast, safe, and reliable passage between o The goals of operators are to minimize their expenditures and still maintain traffic capacity. Environmentalist groups aim for a reduction of pollution and of the consumption of nonrenewable resources related to traffic. Business-friendly groups advocate better connections to their businesses. An efficient road network has multiple positive effects on the economy, including reducing transportation costs, enabling the concentration of production facilities, fostering spending, inducing new real estate development projects, etc. It is well known from various statistical indicators that new roads induce an increase in gross domestic product GDP 2. The value generated by road traffic is estimated at CHF 46 billion or about 10 of the GDP. The absolute increase in GDP due to new or improved road links is very difficult to quantify. In infrastructure management, marginal changes in GDP are estimated by monetarily quantifying changes in traffic conditions. The goals of external stakeholders are difficult to quantify monetarily. Assessment models for the user costs or benefits with various levels of sophistication are currently available. Unfavorable changes in traffic conditions can occur either on the supply side, due to natural deterioration, catastrophic events, etc., or on the demand side, e.g., due to traffic increase and load increase.  Preservation and improvement interventions are to be treated separately. Preservation interventions do not induce any user benefit since the level of service before and after the intervention remains unchanged. The purpose of improvement interventions is to reduce user costs, i.e., induce long-term user benefit less congestion, higher speeds, heavier trucks. For road structures on Swiss national roads, the assessment units are structural elements. It is, therefore, necessary to define the elements for each structure prior to first inspection. Elements are primarily classified using a catalogue of element types and so-called construction types. A condition rating describes the type, severity, and extent of damage. Type of damage is, in this context, a synonym for the deterioration process. A scale of five CS was adopted, ranging from 1 good condition to 5 requiring urgent attention. The condition forecast allows defining preservation projects for any given period in the future. The forecast requires a model that simulates the future condition of an element or segment, given the current condition and the likely environmental influences. Markov chains are used for the condition forecast. The deterioration process is modeled by its own, characteristic Markov chain. The transition matrices of the Markov chains are calculated and updated by a statistical analysis of the condition data collected during inspections. Portions of the same element subjected to the same deterioration process may behave differently. An unfavorable influence may also correspond to the presence of multiple deterioration processes or to defects. The effect of the influence indicators is implemented by adding so-called influence matrices to the transition matrices of the Markov chains. A preservation intervention results in a CS improvement, which is represented by transition probabilities reflective of the effectiveness of the intervention. The transition probabilities representing intervention effectiveness are calculated and updated by a statistical analysis of the condition data collected during inspections before and after interventions 5. The results of the optimization reduce the number of element interventions that are to be considered for project generation. In order to explain the optimization procedure, an optimum policy will be assumed according to which, for instance, interventions will be performed in condition state 3. Four intervention policies I2 to I5 and the corresponding expected intervention intervals are presented in Figure 7. The optimum preservation policy is I4 since it minimizes the expected annuities. It can be seen that the optimization procedure is in principle independent of the deterioration function. A project is generated for a structure as soon as one of its elements requires an intervention. The extent of an intervention to be performed and its unit cost are used to calculate the intervention cost. The preservation project generated using the optimum policies for all elements is of particular interest, since it consists of optimum element interventions. The interventions for all elements segments of a structure form a project. The project is characterized by the sum of the costs of interventions. A model has been developed that takes into account the former performance of particular elements to decide whether or not they should undergo interventions. This model will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter. Interventions on certain elements may require traffic restrictions. Examples include the repair or rehabilitation of pavement, a bridge deck, joints, or retaining the walls along a road. Optimization on the project level aims to support the agency in deciding which projects to perform in a planning period. The optimization on the project level is not needed if sufficient funds are available. If, however, the available funds are not sufficient, an optimum set of projects is estimated that fits into the available budget. This problem is known as the knapsack problem. Markov transition probabilities can be regarded as relative frequencies of a large number of observed condition state transitions. For instance, the coefficient p expresses the relative 23 frequency of observed transitions from CS 2 in CS 3. This also means that by the law of large numbers the same relative frequency of transitions can be expected in the future. There is only a probability p for the whole damage zone to deteriorate further ii1 from CS i into CS i1. Consequently, if the chosen preservation policy requires intervention in condition state i1 this intervention will be performed only with a probability of p . This is ii1 clearly not desirable since in reality this intervention is either going to be performed or not be performed. For the project-level planning a deterministic trigger is therefore required that would solve this KUBA system conceptually consists of four components. KUBA-DB is a data collection system and serves as a basis for the other components. It enables user-friendly collection of inventory, preservation, and inspection. KUBA-DB stores information on people and organizations involved with construction, inspection, and maintenance. The main benefit for authorities stems from KU BA-MS. The approach explained in the previous section is implemented in KUBA -MS. KUBA 4.0 was officially released on December 4, 2007. The concept for the next version KUBA 5.0 is already finished. Its realization is to start in April 2008, and will be finished in April 2010. KUBA 5.0 will include GIS Representation and Linear Referencing. It will be possible to Draft or import an outline of a road structure and Superimpose an outline in an aerial photo, raster, or vector cartographic material. Tunnels will be implemented to allow the collection of tunnel data. The potential of 3-D representation for collecting inspection data and defining the extents of preservation intervention is widely recognized. In Figure 10 a photo obtained during a tunnel inspection is shown. The photo is calibrated in tunnel coordinates so that the collected data obtain geographical reference automatically. There are both technical and administrative obstacles in integrating components of major computer-assisted drafting and GIS vendors in road structure management systems. ewing of 3-D models but also collecting damages such as cracks and corrosion areas directly on the screen. In the current approach the benefit of preservation projects stems from expected savings of agency costs. This means that two identical road structures in the same CS could be treated equally even if the consequences of their failure were vastly different. This can be justified only if there is zero probability of failure, which is clearly not the case with natural hazards. KUBA was developed by cques Dobler, who with vigor and confidence made the development of KUBA possible. To be presented at 10th International Bridge and Structure Management Conference, October 2022, 2008. This paper describes the implementation and utilization of the bridge management system BMS of the Department of Transport and Public Works of the Western Cape Provincial Government. The system consists of inventory, inspection, condition, budget, and maintenance modules and is capable of utilizin. The BMS database is integrated with the Departments Road Network Information System. The systems visual assessment methodology is based on a 4-point DERU Degree, Extent, Relevancy and Urgency system. The project, which included the rehabilitation of 65 structures, was awarded in September 2006 and completed in a period of 15 months. The Roads Infrastructure Branch of the Provincial Government of the Western Cape is responsible for the management of 6,000 km of paved and 10,000km of unpaved roads. These are basically all rural roads in the province that are not national routes and include approximately 2,300 bridges and major culverts. The PGWC identified the need to acquire a management system to motivate for and allocate limited available funds to rehabilitation projects. As in the case of most road authorities, bridge and road maintenance and rehabilitation are funded from the same budget and have to compete for funds. In 2000 the Provincial Government Western Cape adopted the STRUMAN Bridge Management System 1. Modules to accommodate retaining walls, sign gantries, and minor culverts are in the process of being included in the system. All 2,300 bridges and major culverts on the provincial road network were inspected and the data captured into the BMS. During the past few decades, little attention has been given to the overall condition of structures in general. Many of the bridge rehabilitation projects that were commissioned were done on an ad hoc basis. Using the B MS, the Design Directorate now proposes a program of rehabilitation. STRUMAN BMS consists of an Inventory Module, Inspection Module, Condition Module, and Budget Module. System is currently being updated to include access to bridge and culvert drawings in electronic format. The Inspection Module contains the detailed inspection data for each structure. The Condition Module structures are prioritized in order of the need for repair or rehabilitation. The main sections are Inspection heading and summary, Ratings, Remedial work activities, and Inspection photos. The Condition Index CI is used to rank the structures in terms of overall condition. The Functional Index FI is combined with the Priority Index to take into account the strategic importance of the structure or route on which it is located. The Overall Priority Index OPI is a weighted combination of the PI and FI. The BMS utilizes a defects-based rating system DERU. Each defect of a structure element is rated according to its degree D, extent E, and relevancy R. An urgency U rating is also given to indicate the perceived urgency of the proposed remedial activity.  e relevancy rating forces the bridge inspector to evaluate the consequences of the defect in terms of the bridge serviceability and safety. Each of these parameters is combined in the condition module to determine a priority index for each structure. As many as possible of the locally based bridge engineers were given the opportunity to engage in bridge inspections for the PGWC. Inspectors were required to record all visual defects. This information, together with the inventory and inspection photographs, was then captured by the inspector into the BMS. Not all the inspectors had similar previous bridge design and rehabilitation experience. 15 bridge inspectors are perhaps too many to achieve a satisfactory degree of consistency. This was the first round of inspections with the STRUMAN system and thus electronic comparisons with previous inspections were not possible. 68 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference. At this stage it is envisaged that principal lower cost inspections will be undertaken every 5 to 7 years as well as on completion of the repair and rehabilitation of structures. All structures with a Priority Index value below 60 were identified as requiring attention and displayed in the Map Module. Areas with a radius of approximately 50 km were identified where the highest concentrations of structures in the above category were situated. Each of these areas was earmarked as a project and all the structures in these areas were identified to be included in the project 2. The aim is to group bridge rehabilitation into projects of suitable size that can be awarded to one construction firm. The final selection of structure maintenance projects also takes into account planned road maintenance projects. The Eden District Municipality area southwestern region of the province had about 50 structures with a priority index less than 60. The BKSGOBA Joint Venture was appointed by the Department of Transport and Public Works, Provincial Administration Western Cape Road Infrastructure Branch in January 2005. 70 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 Internation. sign, tender documentation, and site supervision of the rehabilitation of 65 bridges and major culverts in the Calitzdorp, Oudtshoorn, and De Rust area 3. The locations of these structures are shown in Figure 2. The contract was mainly intended to address bridge remedial measures only. It was subsequently decided to reassess the scope of work and omit all the road works items that were not considered essential for the safe functional operation of the bridges. Construction of the above work was completed in January 2008. The condition of the concrete of the structures was generally good. The structures were generally in a fair to good structural condition except for the specific structural problems, which need to be addressed to ensure the safe functional operation. Most of the asphalt over the bridge decks appeared old with excessive voids and poor compaction. The waterways and approaches were in a reasonable condition requiring attention in some instances. The majority of bridge joints was in a fair to poor condition. Vandalism at Nell, Nordengen, and Newmark 71 had occurred. Bearings were generally in a good condition. Selected road safety elements were also identified for repair. No significant impact on road and rail traffic was expected. New asphalt surfacing would be provided over the exposed concrete surfaces of the bridge decks. Extensive upgrading of approach guardrails and drainage elements was also proposed. Ancillary elements that impacted significantly on road safety were also addressed in this option. Project cost estimates during the planning stages for the above options are summarized in Table 1 with the final construction costs. A major part of the cost related to ancillary items such as traffic accommodation and road works drainage, asphalt surfacing, signage, and guardrails. The most significant cost increase estimate versus final was primarily attributed to the asphalt resurfacing of the bridge decks. This activity was recommended to ensure that the roadway and joints after repairs would have a similar life expectancy. The tendered values were ho Costs found to be significantly higher than the estimate as provided in Cost Option B above. The main contributing factor related to the oversubscription of construction work in the industry. Scour protection works were also more costly due to limited sources of rock in the area. Access and traffic accommodation requirements have significant cost implications. Location and number of breakouts also have a significant impact on cost and time on a repair contract. Record of costs, product specifications, installation dates, and product guarantees as well as requirements for future maintenance interventions. After completion of the repair works, all 65 of the structures were reinspected using the BMS assessment approach and reprioritized as part of the main database. Table 2 shows the revised Priority and Condition Indices and rankings of 13 structures. Figure 3 shows examples of structures where structural repairs were performed.

The 2003 BMS assessment results were used for defining the scope of the pilot bridge and culvert rehabilitation project in the Eden region. In a number of instances significant additional repairs were carried out that were not evident from the original inspection data. Major repairs were performed on 20 of the structures. These included severe erosion damage repair by means of concrete underpinning. Consideration should be given to including a pre-repair principle inspection in the BMS.  Generic BMS repair activities should be updated to allow for major repair options. Inspectors should be advised to take a conservative approach. A clear distinction should also be made between normal maintenance-type activities e.g. painting, joint repairs, and bush clearing. Nonstructural cracking and bearing replacement items were noted. The monitoring of certain aspects is considered important. These include waterway scour and debris buildup as well as structural cracking. Related defects have been retained in the inspection listing. The inventory module has been provided with specific data fields for drawings and photos of repairs and retrofitting that have been updated. Key inventory photos such as views of watercourses and safety features should be taken at regular intervals. This will also assist in the monitoring and control of maintenance activities. L levels of pavement management systems and BMS is important. Substandard geometric elements such as bridge widths are recorded in the inventory but are not flagged clearly. Geometric upgrading must be flagged to ensure consideration for future upgrades. The development and implementation of the STRUMAN BMS for the Western Cape Provincial Government has led to a significant improvement in the management of structures on the provincial road network. All 2,300 bridges and major culverts were visually assessed during the period 2001 to 2003. The 175 worst structures were identified for inclusion in a bridge repair and rehabilitation program. The pilot project has highlighted a number of areas for the improvement of the BMS. These relate mainly to recording and tracking of defects as well as costing and grouping of repair activities in contracts. Système de Gestion des Structures SGS has a number of novel features designed to meet the specific needs of the Ministry of Transport of Québec. This paper highlights the design of the system, presents some of the challenges faced by the Ministry and gives an overview of the analytical features of the systems analytical engine. 4,300 are provincial bridges, 4,400 are municipal bridges, and the remaining are retaining walls and other miscellaneous structures. These structures are managed in a largely decentralized process by the Head Office and 14 regional offices. The SGS combines lessons learned from the Ontario Bridge Management Syst. The SGS has an Inventory and Inspection Module, which was deliv- ered in early 2007, and a Strategic Planning Module MPS, released in early 2008. The SGS is the first French language BMS of its kind. MTQ rated the material condition of each bridge component using a scale from 1 to 6 with 6 being an ele- ment in new condition. The numbers on the scale represented a combination of severity of de- fects and their extent. The inspector is required to record the quantity of defects in each of four condition states for each bridge component. These condition states are Excellent or A Good or B Fair or C and Poor or D. Each condition state defines defects on the basis of their severity. MTQ maintains an enterprise Oracle database for its structure inventory and inspection data. Data from the Oracle database are replicated to a Microsoft SQL server database. The replication process offers an added measure of security from unintended database updates. MTQ is moderately decentralized in its decision-making processes. Bridge-level maintenance and repair decisions are made in regional offices from operational funding. All analysis in the SGS is performed in the Strategic Planning Module or MPS. The SGS reports several management indices. These indices are the bridge condition index BCI or in French IES, IFS a functionality index, IVS seismic vulnerabilityadequacy, and ICS a combined index of the others. Although each of these indices could be used as a performance measure, only the BCI IES is actually used in the analysis. The MTQ bridge con- dition index is based on the same concept as the OBMS BCI. The BCI is a weighted average of the condition state distribution for the various elements that make up a given structure. The element replacement cost is used as the weighting factor. Family of decision support tools to assist in bridge project planning and program planning. All of the tools work within an integrated engineeringeconomic framework based on the concept of life-cycle costs. The analyses are organized into three levels of detail, as shown in Figure 1. Ellis, Thompson, Gagnon, and Richard 81 Project Alternatives can be programmed. Each level of analysis provides a set of evaluated alternatives to feed the broader-scale tool to its left. All three levels are designed to stay consistent with each other. The MPS generates two Element Alternatives, one for each implemen- tation period, each with a life-cycle activity profile. The treatment is modeled to occur in either year 0 or year 5, which causes an immediate change in condition according to the treatment effectiveness model. The tactical planning tool, described below, is used for evaluating fine-grained changes in scheduling. For the calculation of life-cycle costs and benefits, the treatment cost is calculated from a benchmark unit cost and discounted to year 0. any time during the planning period makes very little difference to the results, so it is ignored. MPS analysis supports three levels of program planning tools. At the Element Level, treatment cost effectiveness is shown with corre- sponding life-cycle cost and resulting deterioration curve. System recommended or user selected element treatments can be used. Budgeting and Network-Level Trade-Off Analys. Budgeting results are displayed across admin- istrative subsets of the inventory. Target performance measures BCI can be set and required budgets determined. The network-level analysis screen shows graphically the trade-off between funding and performance. The Tactical Planning Dashboard complements the Strategic Planning Module by adopting a purely bridge-level perspective on the planning of future work. While the analysis is similar to MPS, the dashboard fills an important gap in several ways. MPS uses decision rules, budget constraints, and benefitcost analysis to drive the prioritization and scheduling of work. Digital Dashboard uses the same tools, but in an evaluative way, to show the effect on performance measures. Project-level decision making using the Digital Dashboard is likely to include a wider va- riety of information than what is provided in the MPS. Such information includes the engineers personal knowledge of the site, design plans, various kinds of testing, and engineering judgment. An innovative digital Tactical Planning Dashboard that complements the MPS. It provides a purely bridge-level per- spective on the planning of future work. It enables detailed study of project analysis results and other information only available in several different screens. Bridge Preservation, Maintenance, and Deterioration Rates. IBSMC08-038A BRIDGE PRESERVATION, MAINTENANCE, AND DETERIORATION RATES Preserving Our Bridge Infrastructure. An overview of ongoing and bridge preservation roadmaps developed by national administrative organizations. Partnership opportunities with established or nascent bridge preservation groups from state agencies, academia, industry, and engineering organizations. Innovative strategies implemented by various agencies will be highlighted. KUBA provides decision support in planning preservation interventions. The system relies on forecasts about the future development of a structural elements condition state. KUBA takes intervention effectiveness into account as the probability that a structural element will be destroyed. Historical data are available for the elements condition states. in a certain condition after the intervention has been carried out. An elements condition is usually only known at the oldest inspection before the intervention, and the youngest inspection afterwards. KUBA. .0 provides decision support in planning preservation interventions. In KUBA-MS, the deterioration of a structural element is modeled by a discrete Markov chain. The comparison of preservation strategies requires information about the effectiveness of Preservation interventions. KUBA-DB will be used to gather and store element-level inspection data. It will also gather information on the cost and extents of realized preservation projects. This paper describes two algorithms for statistically estimating the deterioration and effectiveness matrices. The deterioration of a structural element through its condition states is modeled by a discrete Markov chain X 1,2, with an Expectation Maximization algorithm. An algorithm is proposed that uses the condition state probabilities to predict condition states for the points in time immediately before and after a preservation intervention, which then serve as input to estimate intervention effectiveness. The relation Based on the Markov chain X, optimal preservation interventions are determined using a t Markov Decision Process MDP. The choice for an action a has two consequences. First, t it determines the probabilities PX jX i,a a P a of transitioning into each state j t1 t t ij after choosin. KUBA-MS determines the long-term cost-optimal preservation strategy A for each structural element. The probabilities P a are called t ij the effectiveness transition probabilities of the preservation intervention a. As of 2008, Swiss bridge inspection data will be gathered in the database system K UBA-DB. The Markov deterioration model in KUBA-MS considers 5-year periods, which equals the desired average time span between bridge inspections. In practice, inspections do not take place exactly every 5 years, and the time spans between subsequent inspections can be in the range of 3 to 10 years. To overcome the resulting a-synchronicity between the inspection data and the deterioration model, the The switch from 5-year periods to a 1-year inspection model yields a situation in which most of the yearly inspection data are missing for a given structural element. To deal with the problem of missing data, an Expectation Maximization EM algorithm is applied. Sherlaw-Johnson et al. 2 proposed an explicit EM algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the transition probabilities of a discrete Mark The EM algorithm takes theHajdin and Peeters 93 following inspection matrix I that contains the inspection results for all structural elements of a certain element type. The matrix below shows an example of an inspection matrix for 4 structural elements under a five state condition classification s 1,,5 for a 10-year time horizon T 0,,9. his algorithm was implemented and tested for KUBA-MS. The EM algorithm proposed by Sherlaw-Johnson et al. 2 operates as described in Algorithm 1. In fact, the algorithm does not use the inspection matrix I directly, but computes the observed number of transitions O given by I from state i to state j that occurred over the time span t. Expectation Step Compute estimate of the one-period number of transitions N ij t1 N Pt O Q ij mnt ijk,mnt m,n,t k0 where Q is computed as follows.

In practice, there are several candidates for the starting matrix. One could use a deterioration matrix stemming from expert judgment, such as the ones used in KUBA-MS so far. A perfect deterioration data set was constructed first, with condition states for each structural element for every period. About 80 of the entries from this perfect data set were then removed to construct an inspection data set in which every structural element is inspected on average every 5 years. The following 1-year deterioration matrix was used as starting matrix for Algorithm 1. t of 35 structural elements for a time horizon of 26 periods. With the termination criterion 0.0001, the EM algorithm comp The effectiveness probabilities in KUBA-MS have so far been determined by experts. As with transition probabilities, inspection data on condition states before and after preservation interventions form a rich data source for estimating the effectiveness probabilities. Table 1 presents the Data Set for Estimating the Deterioration Matrix Period. The Data Set is broken down by the period of the study. The Period of Study is shown from 1 to 16. Table 1. Data Set.

For a given preservation intervention, such data are available for several structural elements of a certain element type. interventions effectiveness for the element type is estimated by the relative frequency counts similar to P in the preceding section. ij Preservation Intervention Effectiveness Procedure in Detail. The expected condition state of each structural element is predicted from the oldest inspection before the intervention. Then, intervention effectiveness is estimated based on the expected condition states for the time points immediately before and after the preservation intervention. ndition state vector for structural element x in period t old old s x The condition state vectors for structuralelement x inperiod t young young. Note that s x and s x are unit vectors. The Markov chain X is not in general time t t reversible 2. The Markov matrix entry P is after ji interpreted as the proportional probability to go back in time from state i to state j. To that end, compute the backtracking transition matrix B as P B ji ij P k ki. The algorithm calculates the expected intervention effectiveness for each structural element. It adds the results of these computations, and normalizes the resulting structural element type effectiveness matrix EX. For simplicity, the description assumes that every structural element of type X has received exactly one preservation intervention. In KUBA-MS, it is assumed that a structural element can only transition into two conditions states after a preservation intervention. Any probability mass E X for entries with j 3 is proportionally redistributed to the ij entries E X and E X in a post-processing step. A perfect data set was constructed with the condition states for each of 35 structural elements for all 12 periods. 6 of which lie before the starting time point of the preservation intervention in period 5, and 6 after the finishing time point in period 6.

Hajdin and Peeters 101 RELATION BETWEEN DAMAGE EXTENT and PRESERVATION INTERVENTION EXTENT Besides computing the optimal long-term preservation strategies, KUBA-MS also offers the possibility to simulate preservation strategies for a number of periods. Recall that a deterministic optimal preservation strategy always exists for a Markov decision process, that is, a strategy that assigns a single optimal. The optimal strategy a dictates that whenever a structural element is in state i, the preservation intervention ai must be carried out. In practice, however, a preservation intervention will only be carried. out if the damage extent in condition state i is sufficiently large. The function fd is estimated with a modified regression procedure, which is inspired by the so-called piecewise linear regressio. Based on a data set of n observed preservation interventions with intervention extent fractions f ,,f and the corresponding damage extent fractions d , ,d for a given intervention type. Proposed piecewise linear regression procedure employs a similar objective function. The modification stems from the fact that the general hockey stick shape of the function fd is known. The only parameters to be estimated are the locations of the breakpoints S and L, and the slope a and offset b. The estimation algorithm enumerates all sensible values of S and L. For each considered pair of values S,L, it computes the corresponding scores SSE and SSE , as 0 1 well as a classical linear regression for the data points with S d L, yielding the score SSE . i RHajdin and Peeters 103. Algorithm 3 describes the resulting piecewise regression 0 1 R a. Algorithm 3 was tested on a data set for 45 interventions, with the damage and intervention extent fractions shown in Figure 2. In order to test the effectiveness of estimating S and L up to two decimals only, a second test was performed for adata set of 7,000 interventions. The estimated breakpoints of both algorithms did not show a significant difference. This wealth of data provides a valuable source for estimating various parameters of the management system component KUBA-MS. The paper proposed statistical algorithms for estimating ALGORITHM 3. The shape of the function relating damage extent to preservation intervention extent was also considered. The proposed algorithms will need to be validated using the actual data gathered in KUBA-DB. Based on the validation results, the algorithms may need slight modification, and algorithm input parameters will require fine tuning. IBSMC08-011 BRIDGE PRESERVATION, MAINTENANCE, AND DETERIORATION RATES. National Database System for Maintenance Actions on Highway Bridges. National Cooperative Highway Research Program Project 14-15 has directly addressed this need. The project viewed the problem as capturing data from routine maintenance management processes and converting them for use in bridge management systems. Microsoft Excel and Access, Visual Basic, eXtensible Markup Language, and Javascript, was developed to demonstrate the conversion procedures. The software was applied to data from several state departments of transportation to compute bridge management system unit costs and action effectiveness measures. Policy-level definitions of maintenance were obtained from AASHTO 1, 2, from FHWA and from nine state transportation agencies. Maintenance actions include routine cleaning and painting as well as repairs and replacements of components. Jorgensens NCHRP report on budgeting for highway maintenance 4 defines maintenance as actions that preserve assets in their as-constructed condition. State DOTS often define maintenance in a similar narrow sense maintenance preserves bridges. Most state DOTs identify maintenance actions in all operations shown in Table 1. Repairs or replacements of components are often classified as maintenance. Larger projects for improvement, bridge reconstruction, and bridge replacement are not maintenance. Some DOTs have separate categories for maintenance of movable spans, of motion equipment, of tunnels, and of other structural assets. Bridge replacement and reconstruction are excluded from maintenance. Improvements to bridges may be maintenance, if projects are small. Budget Budgets in transportation departments identify funds for the maintenance division, for contract maintenance, and for equipment and materials used in maintenance tasks. Bridge replacement or major rehabilitation projects that are eligible for HBRRP funds are not maintenance. Repairs, component replacements, and minor modifications are usually maintenance and may be eligible for HBRRP funds. Bridge replacement and major rehabilitations are not maintenance. The existence, and essential immutability, of each bridge and its makeup are necessary attributes.  maintenance programs consist of two broad categories cyclic work and singular work. A third category, Updating, may be added, though it is not prominent in DOT literature on maintenance. Updating is work to replace obsolete elements such as bridge railings. Bridge maintenance can be defined in terms of policy statements, lists of actions, budget status and the capabilities of maintena. Some DOTs identify maintenance contracts as a separate class, and compute distinct values of average unit costs for pay items in these contracts. U.S. DOTs all recognize maintenance as distinct from construction. Cleaning, painting, and minor repairs are always maintenance. Emergency work, usually in response to accidents or extreme weather, is classified as maintenance. Actions can be used with maintenance operations to provide more detail on the work performed. Numbering for actions is shown in Table 3. When actions are used, numbering for maintenance items has three fields, identifying in order, a component, an operation and an action.

        "response": "The numbering system easily rolls up from its more detailed implementation to more terse. The numbering system allows simple collection of maintenance data by bridge component or by maintenance operation. The conceptual framework for the cost analysis comes in four phases. Economic outputs are a description of work completed in maintenance activities. These include labor, materials, equipment, and contract pay items. Outputs typically use different units of measure than inputs. Typically, the purpose of maintenance activity is to change a deteriorated condition into a better condition. Both cost and quantity of both inputs and outputs are used in the analysis. If any are missing, the analysis can still work without them. The outcome is generally measured by bridge inspection, usually the next regular inspection after the work is done. Costs and quantities can be rolled up i.e., summed to any level of aggregation where it makes sense. Quantities are not necessarily rolled up to the same levels as cost because of the need for compatibility of measurement units. All cost data originate with costs gathered in the maintenance management process. Each activity is identified by use of the maintenance catalog with component, operation, and action. The analysis computes unit costs and performance measures from this information.  e table. qty_out Quantity of output, from the event_activity table. ucost_inp Unit cost of inputs, from event_resource table. cost_out Cost of output work accomplished, from Event Table. u cost_res Unit cost relative to resulting condition, computed as cost_ out.  r determining the quantity of work required in response to inspection data. prod_ func Production function, cost_inp cost_out, a measure of the amount of a given input required in order to achieve a desired output. prob1 .. prob5 Pontis action effectiveness probabilities.  Maintenance action 1.04.01, deck repairpatch, matches 46 different AASHTO CoRe element actions for different elements and condition states. Nearly every combination of component, operation, and action that corresponds to a bridge management action, corresponds to more than one of them. Cost allocation procedure resolves this issue. The algorithm adds up the costs over all activities and resources in an event to get the events input and output cost totals. It associates each element inspection on a structure with the next element inspection after it. It asks the question, If we ended up working on this element, how did it turn out? Pontis 13 allows an element to appear more than once in an inspection. A maintenance activity can affect multiple elements, and an element can be affected by multiple activities. We can narrow the list of possible associations in this many-to-many relationship by using the results of step 1. When more than one element might have been affected, it is valid to allocate the output costs among elements on the basis of quantity of improved condition. If no elements improved, but any were deteriorated before, we can eliminate elements that were in perfect condition before the event. Pontis costs are expressed at the level of element, condition state, and action. We allocate costs not just between elements, but also between condition states. After this allocation of costs to elements, it becomes possible to roll up allocated output costs by type of element.  output costs are fully assigned to each BMS action that was not previously eliminated for each condition state. This makes it possible to calculate the quantity function, which directly relates quantities of work, in output units, to quantities of deterioration, in bridge inspection units. In Pontis, the condition of an element following an MRR action is forecast using a vector of transition probabilities. These probabilities are memory-less that is, they dont depend on the condition before the action. To perform this computation, first each event is associated with the inspection following the event. The methodology is sensitive to the agencys procedures for estimating the output cost of maintenance activities, which are not always as rigorous. There can be great variations from one project to another. More in-depth research using the research products may uncover and quantify the factors that cause variation.  NMDB is a combination of tools that support various parts of an ongoing process. These tools make the best use of generic technologies for each phase of the data life cycle. A generic bridge maintenance database, delivered in XML format. An Excel workbook file called The Organizer. This file contains procedures for importing, converting, organizing, and editing the XML database. The organizer can import data from an agency maintenance management database provided the database meets certain standards.

The New York State Department of Transportation maintains an inventory of more than 17,000 highway bridges across the state. Bridge inspectors are required to assign a condition rating for up to 47 structural elements of each bridge. This paper describes the development of bridge element deterioration rates using the NYSDOT bridge inspection database. It is observed that a Weibull-based approach is more reliable for developing bridge deterioration curves. Case studies on deterioration rates of various bridge elements in New York State are presented to demonstrate the two approaches. Condition assessment of the bridge infrastructure is crucial in preparing 5- and 10-year capital programs for the construction and maintenance of bridges. More than 31 of bridges in the United States are considered deficient. Information is extremely valuable in bridge management decision making. The deterioration rates of individual bridge elements are influenced by the combined effects of many complex phenomena e.g. reinforcement corrosion, concrete degradation, creep, shrinkage, cracking, and fatigue. In the absence of mechanistic-based deterioration models that require the quantitative contribution of these complex phenomena, bridge inspection data may be used to estimate future rehabilitation Bridge elements deteriorate over time and their conditions do not improve without some type of intervention. Better understanding of these issues is essential for developing and implementing an effective bridge management program. Data preprocessing is a critical first step in deterioration curve development. All data before the improvement were discarded. For analysis purposes these data where not included as we were interested in the development of deterioration rates of nonrehabilitated elements. Algorithms were developed to handle the data differently based on h. eled is properly handled. For certain elements, additional criteria were added to improve results. Weathering steel bridges that had an estimated element year built before 1968 were removed from the data analysis. For example, a bridge element that was at condition rating 5 for 6 years and then went to condition rating 6 for 2 years was recorded as having been at condition rated 5 for 14 years. Bridge deterioration is a stochastic process that depends on many factors, such as average annual daily truck traffic AADTT, climate, and maintenance level. This pre-analysis filtering was crucial in arriving at the most accurate deterioration information. This paper presents a comparative study of deterioration rates calculated by Markov chains and Weibull-based distributions using NYSDOT bridge inspection data. Markovian models are the most common stochastic techniques and have been used extensively in modeling deterioration rates. Markovian models address the uncertainty of the deterioration process and account for the current facility condition in predicting the future. They still suffer from several limitations such as a they assume discrete transition time intervals, constant bridge population, and stationary transition probabilities. Markov chains is the most widely used approach for deterioration modeling. For the NYSDOT bridge inspection system, seven bridge condition ratings from 7 to 1 can be defined as seven Markovian states with each condition rating corresponding to one of the seven states. There is a probability, p , of a bridge element transiting from one condition ij state to another state, j, between inspections. The probability of state i not transitioning to state j is then 1 p . By knowing this probability for each of the states transitioning, e.g., 1 to 2, ij 2 to 3, 3 to 4, etc., we can obtain the transition matrix P. The deterioration rate at any age can be defined as the slope of the condition rating curve in Equation 3. matrix P raised to 0 the power t, i.e., Q Q0 Pt 2 t where Q is the state vector at any time t. The transition matrix P can be calculated by formulating the nonlinear programming objective function asAgrawal, Kawaguchi, Zheng, Lagace and DeLisle 123 N min Yt R subject to 0 pi1. In the Markov chains approach, nonhomogeneity of the continuous deterioration process is captured indirectly through segmentation of bridge elements into age groups, i.e., 010 years, 1020 years, etc. A new bridge element is almost always given a condition rating of 7. The transition matrix P is determined using nonlinear programming in Equation 4 for each age group. Nonlinear optimization in Equation 4 will not converge and will essentially give the transition matrix P as a unity matrix or close to it. This issue has been observed by carrying out a second level Markov process. In this process, data generated by Markov chains processes using 10-year age groups are used as original data. Markov chains data generated by this transition matrix will follow the dominant deteriorating behavior during the first 40 years. For each condition rating, T durations is assumed to comprise a random sample from the Weibull i distr. An increasing failure rate means that at any particular time, the longer an element has been at a particular condition rating CR, the more likely it will transition to a lower CR. The shape parameter determines whether the so-called failure or hazard rate is decreasing or increasing. Distributions of durational phenomena at a particular rating are typically skewed and consequently are rarely normally distributed. The most frequently used distributions for such data are the Weibull and lognormal. It has been shown by DeLisle et al. 17 that the WeIBull distribution generally provides the best overall fit for infrastructure deterioration data. The probability that a bridge deck entering into CR6 at some particular time remaining at CR6 for more than 10 years is obtained from Equation 5 as PT 10 S 1 e 6 6 0.74. The probability that the deck will transition to CR5 in 10 or less years is 1 0.26.  mean T for a condition rating i is calculated by i 1 E T ηΓ1 6 i i β i where Γ is the gamma function. For example, T5 for CR5 to CR4 is 23 years and t25 11 years. This means that 25 of the samples of an element will transition toCR4 within 11years. Markov chains and Weibull distribution-based approaches in calculating deterioration rates are illustrated through several case studies as described next. It has been observed that Markov chains follow the original data more closely. It is observed that plate girders made of weathering steel deteriorate slower than those made of steel from the beginning.  plate girders made of steel and weathering steel deteriorate at the same rate during first 20 years. Markov chains approach also cannot take into consideration censored condition data. Censoring takes place when the duration at a specific condition level is not completely observed. This happens for the latest condition rating on file or when the condition rating of a bridge element is improved. In Markov chains, there are only two choices regarding censored observation. disregard them or treat them as actual durations. Either of these choices may lead to seriously biased estimates. Weibull distribution-based approach can handle censored data by explicitly considering duration dependency. Weibull-based approach can be considered to be more reliable probabilistically. terioration hazard rate is increasing and that it is durationally dependent. It is observed that both steel and weathering steel plate girders deteriorate identically until 20 years to CR6. The CRs of decks with uncoated rebars drop from 7 to 5 in 32 years. For structural decks with epoxy-coatedRebars, this happens in 38 years. When the Weibull-based approach is used, CRs drop from 5 to 7 in 31.5 and 37.6 years. It is observed that decks of locally owned bridges deterioriate slightly faster than those owned by NYSDOT. Higher rates of deterioration in locally owned bridge decks may be because of several factors such as different design standards. Deterioration plots for concrete pier caps in bridges owned by NYSDOT. deteriorate to CRs 6, 5, and 4 in 18, 34, and 54 years. This information can be used for bridge management decisions, such as estimating and scheduling needed maintenance and rehabilitation work. Abutment bearings deteriorate from CR 7 to CRs 6, 5, and 4 in 17, 36, and 58 years, respectively. n predicted by both Markov and Weibull is the same for the first 30 years. This paper presents the development of Markov chains and Weibull distribution-based approaches for the calculation of deterioration rates of different elements. An extensive data conditioning has been done by incorporating specific filtering logic based on detailed and available work history and extensive experience of NYSDOT engineers. Deterioration plots for the Markov chains approach are significantly influenced by the duration independence assumption and scatter in inspection data. The Weibull-based approach is more reliable because of its ability to handle duration dependent and right censored data.

KDOT BLP is responsible for condition assessment and needs analysis for more than 20,000 bridges. KDOT BLP has implemented a web-based system to collect bridge conditions statewide. The objective of maximizing compliance with inspection schedules for all types of inspections, minimizing software implementation obstacles, and eliminating data delivery delays. Local agencies have struggled to comply with the U.S. National Bridge Inspection Standard NBIS. A web-based application has been developed and deployed for their use. The inspection system provides security-controlled access from any Internet-connected computer to all Kansas local agency bridge information. The web application controls access to bridges so that only each agency, or its inspection consultant, can access and modify data from their own bridges. A web browser, thereby reducing the difficulty of training and deployment considerably. Bridgeware is a web-deployed bridge management system. Bridgeware was developed to standardize on the Bridgware database specification for the long run. A number of Kansas local agencies did successfully collect the NBIS bridge data with Pontis 4 and submit it to the BLP. The process was never institutionalized statewide successfully, and inspection program compliance levels continued to deteriorate. The local agencies have only limited data collection responsibilities in actuality. KDOT BLP hoped to expedite the inspection process for local agencies and improve inspection schedule compliance. A web-based solution was designed for the BLP based on the prior web deployment work. The forms and business rules were drastically simplified related to those in the Pontis BMS. KDOT BLP uses Microsoft.NET technology for the web application itself and relies on a third-party toolkit of custom tools. The application uses a standard Pontis database and is completely compatible with existing versions of Pontis. The database for the application is Oracle 10g, Release 2, and the web server technology is Internet Information Server 6. Communication from the web application to the database uses the Oracle Data Provider OLEDB for .NET and ODBC for the reporting subsystem. There is no end user report tool in the system. The two websites use a common code basis with only configuration changes necessary to offer the two alternatives. The web application does not share any user interface or middleware code with Pontis 5.x, but it does utilize the Pontis 4 C DLL capabilities to perform data validations. The KDOT BLP138 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference application manages its own users and user roles. The user interface for the web inspection application is organized into five main elements. The bridge list provides several tools for finding bridges and creating subsets of records. Each list is based on an SQL query, which must include the main bridge identifier. The lists only display bridges that the user is authorized to view by their access privileges. In the KDOT BLP application, the data validation tool relies on the current bridge list and specific bridge selections to identify the bridges that should have data checking performed. The validation tool utilizes the Pontis 4.4 edit check program directly, called from within the web application. The KDOT BLP application will enforce all federal data validation rules for NBI data intrinsically. The batch tool first performs the edit checks and reports the number of warnings and errors. The same validations that are performed by the batch tool are also performed in the data editing detail pages automatically. A mapping mash up based on the public domain Google Maps API is also included in the batch tools. This mapping interface provides pinned map locations for all or selected bridges. Detailed data for each bridge are shown on a series of tab pages that are generated automati. The data forms are organized into several tab pages, and also provide capabilities for inspection approval, by qualified users, report generation, and individual bridge validation. The set of tabs is predefined by design and the tabs cannot be manipulated to change order or labeling except through changes to an underlying database table. With the inspection navigator, the user may move between multiple bridge inspections as needed. The system streamlines data entry requirements for these interim inspections. Inventory inspections are performed when a bridge is added to the inventory, or significantly rehabilitated. The design intentionally omits the ability to add and remove entire structure records. Data validation occurs on each tab page, either on demand, by using the Validate button, or automatically whenever data are saved. If validation fails, a warning message screen is displayed and the user must correct the data problems before the updated record can be saved. The scheduling and compliance tracking report subsystem is used to prepare reports on upcoming and overdue inspections. KDOT BLP staff will be able to determine which bridges need to be inspected, and contact the agency responsible. The on-screen inspection schedule reports can be browsed or formatted for printing. These reports will be a critical tool for improving KDOTBLP compliance with the NBIS inspection and reporting requirements. The application provides a web interface to common administrative tasks. Only users with the KDOT BLP web- administrator role have access to the full range of administration tasks. The report bridge selections and e- mail distribution lists are shared from the web applications administrative tables directly. The application uses a standard .NET authentication provider, which manages the user login process. Both Forms authentication, with a standard login page, and Windows Integrated logins, where automatic logins depend on the users network access credentials, are supported. The application defines a fixed set of five roles of increasing privilege with a browse- only role provided for ad hoc access to the application by KDOT management and other parties. The relatively simple role privilege mechanism may also be extended in the futur. The authentication provider conforms to the .NET provider specification. The KDOT BLP reporting system employs Crystal Reports technology for report definition and generation. All reports are created in Crystal Reports externally to the system, then hard linked in the web application code to menu items. The current application is in the initial deployment phase. More data mining capabilities, including more data mining reports, end user ad hoc report design, and the ability to deploy reports to a widely accessible agency report server.

Linking in other websites supporting the local bridge inspection process. Counties and cities own slightly more than half of the bridges on the National Bridge Inventory. The State of Maryland also has a nearly even split between state and county or city ownership of its 5,000 bridges over 20 ft in length. The software is designed to provide more efficient and less error prone on-site collection and entry of inspection data. Through the end of 2007 a total of 12 different firms have utilized the software in counties and cities throughout the state. Of these bridges slightly more than half are owned by the state and the remainder, 2,200, areowned by its 23 counties, the City of Baltimore, and several smaller entities. Counties and cities departments of public works or engineering offices are mandated to ensure that the inspection of these structures is performed to federal standards. Counties and cities were largely lacking any tools to assist them in managing their bridge population. This problem was espe- cially acute in entities that owned more than 50 bridges. InspectTechs BridgeInspect software suite was used as the solution to meet the needs for an integrated end-to-end system. The core system was customized to correspond to the users exact specifications with interfaces, workprocess flow, maintenance items. Inspection software has both a field and stand-alone version that runs on tablet or laptop computers. Web-based office version for integrating the field data and finalizing the reports. County and city personnel are able to ac- cess all information on bridge structures."

        "response": "The system has been utilized in nine of Marylands counties and cities that collectively represent more than 70 of the states population. Those counties that own the most bridges and have the greatest need for the system also tend to be those located in more dense urban and suburban areas. Garrett County, the most rural county in the state, has also adopted the software to assist it with its own needs. Inspections of structures spanning railroad tracks or the Metro system require signifi- cant coordination with outside agencies. Information obtained from the inspection program forms the basis for identifying bridge deficiencies and obtaining the necessary data for prioritization. The bridge inspection and management program is designed to meet and exceed the requirements specified by the FHWA. FHWAs National Bridge In- spection Standards require the collection of more than 200 pieces of inventory and appraisal data on all 20-ft or larger structures. All of the counties and cities utilize an engineering consulting firm to perform their bridge inspec- tions. Maryland SHA has added on several additional inventory related fields that are not present in the NBI data. Prior to implementation of the integrated inspection and management system the entities relied on a variety of differing formats in order to meet their needs. One of the main fea- tures was the utilization of the states Microsoft Access file to store basic inventory data. Each of the counties and cities independently chose to implement an integrated inspection and management system. There were a number of common reasons and goals that the entities had as well as ones unique to their particular situation. The integrated bridge information and management system is able to serve a variety of user needs from maintenance to bridge managers to higher-level executives. Each subgroup within an implementation requires different permissions and functions to meet their unique needs. The goal was to streamline the inspection and management process for bridges. This would save time and money, and increase the operating efficiency and safety of the bridge network. In order to meet the goals of each county and city, InspectTechs core BridgeInspect Collector and Bridge inspect Manager software was chosen and customized per the specific county or city The system is composed of three primary components. The first component is the field inspection software. This software runs on individual laptop or tablet computers. Once the field work is custom reports done the report is available from any computer. Once the field work is done and the laptop is back in the office or at another location with an Internet connection the data collected are uploaded to the online inspection module. Detailed sketches or load rating analysis sections can be added to the re- port with multiple users working on different sections of the same bridge report. Once all sec- tions have been added the report can go through internal QAQC by the consultant project Shaffer and Schellhase 155 Technical Requirements The system software is designed to run on the typical computers that consultants and office-based managers already have. The bridge management software runs entirely off a server computer and accessed securely through encrypted connections from any Internet computer. It is recommended that a semi-ruggedized or full ruggedized computer with outdoor optimized screen be used for field inspection work. Many of the input screens uti-lize drop down lists for entry and value selection. The intuitive layout of the software application required little training. This report is generated as a PDF file and can be printed out as a standard paper report or submitted electronically to the bridge management system. There are several core features and modules that allow the inspectors to quickly and reliably enter data. The user interface was designed to facilitate quick and easy data entry. The forms in the main window are dynamically generated and offer a number of powerful features to the user. The forms look identical to the standard paper ones that the inspectors have used in the past. However, additional features have been added to make them more interactive. Shaffer and Schellhase 157 type as much information as necessary into any single field. Text areas will automatically scroll when necessary to support large amounts of data. The user interface works on desktops, laptops, and tablet computers. For long forms that cannot be displayed in their entirety within the main window vertical and horizontal scrollbars will automatically appear along either axis that needs to allow for the ability to scroll. A drop-down selection list is available showing all available options and brief descriptions for each item. The BridgeInspect Collector software supports the integration of pictures, sketches, diagrams, and other digital file types. The interface allows inspectors to select any file on their computer or any attached device to load into the report. Software supports an integrated list of county- or city-specific bridge maintenance items and cost estimates. Inspectors can select an item code, assign a priority, and reference pictures. Total cost estimates are automatically generated. Inspectors still retain the ability to override automatic cost estimates based on unique conditions and create entries for problems not on the standard item list. The customized software automatically stitches together a completely formatted report by organizing all information entered. Government personnel can reach the website from any Internet-enabled computer with their secure username and passwords. The manager software uses a drop-down menu based system that provides much the same interaction and experience of a stand-alone program. The page is composed of many sections each of which provides a snapshot of information. A user is able to retrieve complete inspection reports latest or any historical as a PDF file. Summaries of all of the current maintenance needs for the structure are also present. The management software provides the capability to search across any field or combination of fields from within the inspection reports. Results are displayed in tabular form and indexed by bridge. Users can click on the bridge name or code to go directly to the bridge detail page for more information. The management system allows for the uploading and direct storage on the server of any digital file. Files can be associated with Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference dates. The management software integrates directly with Google Maps. All bridges can be plotted directly onto an interactive map of the city or county. Users can select between the roadway layer, a satellite layer, or a combination of both. The map allows for the county users to zoom in and out and see a very high level of detail. The software allows the administrative features necessary to handle the addition, editing, and deletion of bridges as well as new users. A user who is an administrator in the software can create accounts for others with specified permissions and correct access by structure or module. The traditional processes of inspection with disjoint or incomplete databases and extensive usage of static paper reports lead to considerable inefficiencies. Bridge owners and inspectors of all sizes can significantly benefit from adoption of a customizedShaffer and Schellhase 161. Bridge inspection is far more than just collecting data for storage in a file cabinet. Effective bridge inspection software helps to highlight and provide quick and easy access to turn data into useful information. Problems can be quickly identified and documented, and action plans developed. The goal of integrating all bridge information in a single location for quick and easy access with tools to prioritize and highlight problem areas. The U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, D.C., published a guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nations Bridges in 1995. Some bridge owners and stakeholders have suggested that the mandated 2-year NBI inspection interval is not optimal in many situations. The objective of this paper is to use the available NBI data for investigating the condition ratings and time-in- condition of various bridge design types and characteristics. An optimal policy for inspection intervals can be expected to reduce the total inspection program cost and avoid unnecessary traffic delay or lane closure. An inspection interval can be based on the probability that the current bridge condition is about to change. Thermal imaging for Bridge Inspection and Maintenance. Subsurface deterioration in concrete structures presents a significant challenge for inspection and maintenance engineers. Infrared IR cameras provide the opportunity to perform inspections in a noncontact manner that can reduce costs. The primary challenge to applying IR technology in the field is determining if the appropriate environmental conditions exist to provide measurable temperature contrasts between deteriorated and sound concrete. Research results reported in this paper will describe the initial results of a study to develop effective guidelines for the application of IR thermography. There is an increasing focus on the condition assessment, repair, and rehabilitation of concrete components in bridges. Traditional inspection methods such as hammer sounding can detect subsurface deterioration in many cases, but require arm reach access to the surface being inspected. The application of infrared IR 164Washer, Fenwick, Bolleni, Harper, and Alampalli 165 thermography  experimental testing designed to identify the optimum conditions for the detection of subsurface features in concrete bridge components. The experimental testing involves monitoring the thermal response, using both IR cameras and traditional instrumentation, of a large concrete block with targets embedded at various depths. Environmental parameters including wind speed, and solar loading and ambient temperatures are assessed to determine their Traditional methods such as hammer sounding and chain drag techniques may not adequately address current demands in bridge inspection. IR thermography, the technology this study focuses on, has gained increasing use in many industries in recent years due to the advancement of imaging technology. IR cameras infer the temperature of a material by measuring the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface. All materials emit radiation in the IR range when their temperature is above absolute zero. However, IR thermography has some limitations, such as the cameras inability to determine the depth of the features imaged. Emissivity of a material is the characteristic rate of thermal radiation, relative to a black body. For concrete, emissivity values are typically between 0.92 and 0.97. However, there are many other factors that influence the IR image produced. The thermal gradient created by environmental conditions is relatively small. Direct sunlight solar loading can produce a significant thermal gradient by heating the surface of the structure through radiant heating. Wind can mitigate this effect by drawing away heat through convective cooling. The humidity of the air itself will also affect the convective properties. A large test block was constructed as shown in Figure 1. Styrofoam targets of known thickness, area, location, and depth were embedded in the concrete. Thermocouple arrays were manufactured and cast into the block to provide internal block temperature measurement. IR research camera FLIR S65 was used to constantly monitor the surface of the block. Data for variables such as ambient temperature, solar loading, wind speed, humidity, and rainfall were collected and stored by a stand-alone computer system. The IR image displays a two-dimensional temperature representation of the entire face of the block. Temperature differentials thermal gradients were measured by the thermocouples. Thermal contrasts were taken between the surface area directly above the targets and the surface areas directly above sound concrete. The research reported here describes results observed on the south side of the block, which is exposed to direct sunlight. At this stage in the research, fully developed conclusions are yet to be drawn however, useful results have already emerged. The main focus of this research is to determine a good day versus a bad day for detecting subsurface defects with an IR camera. For example, there would be a large clear range of significant thermal contrasts for all four depths. This occurs in the case of January 2, 2008, with an almost sinusoidal waveform in the thermal contrast data being driven by environmental conditions. Figure 3b shows the solar loading, which is consistent throughout the entire day of January 2. Figure 3b for the entire week, a pattern can be easily identified. Despite the magnitude of the solar. loading, there will be diminished thermal contrasts evident in the IR image. The ability to observe thermal contrast relies upon the ability of the concrete to build up heat on one side of a defective region of poor thermal conductivity. It should also be noted that the diurnal variations in ambient temperatures and the day-to- day trends that are apparent in Figure 3a do not appear to have as significant an effect on the thermal contrast. The warming trend that is apparent beginning on January 2 does not appear to result in improved contrasts. It can also be observed that there is staggered development of peak thermal contrasts within an individual day of data. Using again the data from January 2, the 1-in. target reaches its 10C contrast around 1 p.m. Figure 4 shows the actual thermal contrast images for the days from January 1 through 7, 2008. In this specific case and with these specific environmental contributing factors, the propagation rate seems to be advancing at approximately 1 in. per hour. Further analysis should bring more detailed guidelines for this phenomenon. High solar loading is useless if it is not accompanied by a good spells of clear skies for that day. January 2 has a far lower maximum solar loading than, say, January 7, but the thermal contrast for January 7 is still much smaller for each of the targets. Wind speed trend throughout the week shows that only during low daytime wind conditions of less than about 10 ms is the ideal thermal contrast model able to reach its Clear skies, resulting in uninterrupted solar loading, provides greater contrast in thermal images than days when peak solar loading is higher but loading is intermittent due to passing clouds. This result is not unexpected, as the total thermal energy introduced into the block on a clear day can be greater, establishing a greater thermal gradient. Three months of data have been collected on the south side of the test block. Correlation models are being developed to identify optimum conditions for the inspection of concrete structures exposed to direct sunlight."

This research realizes an important role of these facilities bridges, roadside elements, and traffic control devices. This research places an emphasis on developing the multiattribute prioritization framework. The concept of utility functions is applied in order to transfer them into nondimensional units. This proposed framework may help decision makers select a reduced number of alternatives from a larger number of all available alternatives. A number of road agencies in the United States and many other countries implement mathematical techniques for prioritizing their pavement maintenance works. This section discusses literature relevant to this research. He selection of influencing factors like different objectives, their respective performance indicators, and the corresponding weighting factors. There is no rigid framework for prioritization methodology for bridges, roadside elements, and traffic control devices. Most agencies implement their own prioritization framework based on their own experience and actual practice. Lee and Kim 5 proposed optimal maintenance methods for bridge decks. Yang et. 7 predicted the evolution in time of the reliability of deteriorating bridge structures based on lifetime function. Yehia et. 8 developed a decision-support system for bridge deck maintenance considering a certain number of problems. Jha and Abdullah 9 worked on optimizing the highway life cycle with GA.  optimization presents a more complicated mathematical programming, which could be implemented for single and multiyear planning. In multi-objective prioritization, none of the alternatives can be superior in all objectives value. The utility function method is one of the most prominent direct assessment methods that measures and represents the preference of decision makers in the form a real-value function. At present, several studies are available that discuss multi-objective characteristics of highway management systems. Research defines important objectives and their corresponding performance indicators. Expert opinions acquired by questionnaire survey were the foundation of this selection. Three key decision makers were selected from each of the three public highway agencies in Thailand. A preliminary questionnaire was prepared after a comprehensive literature survey. Important factors for bridges, roadside elements, and traffic control device maintenance were listed in this questionnaire. The preliminary questionnaire survey was carried out to define important objectives and their performance indicators. Developing utility functions was the next step of this research. Regression analysis was used to develop the utility equation. Experts were asked for their opinions regarding defined weighting factors of different objectives and performance indicators. Service, condition, safety, cost, socioeconomic factor, and energy should be the important objectives for bridges and traffic Performance Preliminary Questionnaire Objectives Indicators Survey Final Questionnaire Survey Weighting Utility Factors Functions Result Investigation and Validation Prioritization There are 14 performance indicators for bridges, 12 for roadside elements, and 13 for traffic control device maintenance. The outcome of experts opinions reveals that bridge condition should be the most influential factor in maintenance planning.  traffic volume, agency cost, and deck, superstructure and substructure deterioration index are the most influential factors among all the performance indicators. ety, and cost are viewed as mid-level prioritization factors since they contribute 20.556, 20, and 18.333, respectively.

Among the 12 performance indicators, clear roadway width and deflection or displacement are the most important factors. Traffic control devices include various signals, such as signs, pavement markings, and traffic lights. Service, condition, and safety, should be the major factors for the maintenance of this facility. Despite having the least importance, cost, socioeconomic factors, and energy are also important for an effective decision in traffic control device maintenance. For bridge maintenance, load capacity is the performance indicator for both the objectives condition and safety. One function is developed for sight distance and visual quality in roadside element maintenance. For traffic control devices delay time and travel time delay can be represented by one function. Fuel waste and fuel consumption can also be considered as one. Table 6 lists all the utility functions of the objectives for bridge maintenance. Table 7 and 8 summarize the utility function of each objective involved for roadside elements and traffic control device maintenance. By use of the relative weights and the utility. functions of different performance indicators, it is also possible to construct utility equations of different objectives.

A prioritization framework for bridges, roadside elements, and traffic control device maintenance is developed in this study by acquiring the opinions of experts. Questionnaire surveys are carried out in two different steps, each with in-depth interviews. Final decision for the prioritization in maintenance operation should be made after calculation of the total utility value of each of the facilities for a specific maintenance action. This study ignores all the uncertainties and risks that might be associated in bridges. This study only presents a framework for bridges, roadside elements, and traffic control device maintenance. Developing a prioritization framework for other facilities in the highway management system would enhance highway maintenance and help planners conduct trade-off analyses. 4.

Applying utility functions to bridge management practice can extend the practice to incorporate project attributes such as scour potential, seismic risk, collision risk. The California Department of Transportation is responsible for the preservation of more than 13,000 state highway bridges. Caltrans strives to prioritize the best projects based on a number of factors. Evaluating potential projects is not a simple exercise due to the varied nature of the project benefits. The best projects are those that have the maximum benefitcost BC ratio. Ignoring the benefit of risk reduction can lead to network-level optimization and project-level prioritizations that do not reflect an agencys true objectives. The three risk-based programs scour, seismic, and rail account for 189190 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference approximately 40 of the total SHOPP bridge dollars. Caltrans has begun to utilize multiobjective utility theory to prioritize potential bridge projects. The generic form of the total project utility is given by U αβX 1 t i i i. The individual value components can then be weighted and combined to determine an overall project utility based on all the attributes. ces and risk tolerances for any number of attributes. Expanding the generic utility form to address the attributes used to develop the SHOPP in California results in the expanded form. The scour value function can be expressed in mathematical terms or in graphical form. The specific attributes included in Equation 1 are not limited in number. The influence of individual attributes will diminish with each additional item included in the equation. The value function developed for rehabilitation and replacement projects uses the Bridge Health Index BHI 3, ADT volumes, DL, and repair urgency defined by the inspecting engineer. A bridge in good condition as indicated by a high BHI results in a very small value coefficient. As the condition of the bridge deteriorates the value of the rehabilitation and Replacement component of the total project utility increases. The mathematical formulation of the value functions is logit curves 4 of the following form X 11 eCi 3 i where X is the value coefficient for each component of the utility, and i C is a function of the significant decision parameters for each value component. The variable C is shown in Table 1 for all value components. e functions helps with visualization of the concept, but the mathematical equations of the curves are more The weight associated with each component of the total project utility can be determined by a number of methods 5 however sensitivity analysis of the resulting component utilities by experienced bridge engineers proved most effective. The weights developed for each attribute are shown in Table 2. i Rehabilitation and BHI, ADT, repair urgency U, 2.5 .000001100 BHI replacement needs and DL BHITEV100 .000000 Bridge rail upgrade needs Caltrans rail upgrade score RS 2 RS Seismic retrofit needs CalTrans seismic priority S , 1.5 S 0.000001ADTDL v v ADT, and DL Mobility needs Pontis improvement benefit P 4.5 0.00015P raisingstrengthening 6Johnson 193 TABLE 2 Utility Function Weights Attribute Weight Rehabilitation and Post-project utility can be determined by defining the expected post-project state of each value attribute. The real power of the utility approach is realized when one compares projects with a combination of risk reduction and condition improvement. The example shown in Table 3 demonstrates how the risk and condition value functions are weighted and combined together. A BC ratio is the net change in utility from the project divided by the project cost. Bridges with higher utility cost ratios were evaluated for potential programming. Bridge replacements had higher utilities because they often received utility value contributions from multiple components. The cost associated with the net improvement of utility is based on many factors, but is certainly related to the magnitude of the project. Caltrans opted to multiply the net utility benefit by the value of each bridge using the total element value TEV. The application of weighted value functions to develop a single unitless total project utility that incorporates condition and risk attributes was shown to have significant promise for project prioritization. The objective incorporation of risk into the decision-making process is a significant step in the advancement of BMSs. The potential application of this approach in the area of asset management shows real promise. The approach could be. used to evaluate projects across asset classes. It could also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of a project. Bridge managers and engineers are finding that their constituents require bridge projects and programs to perform not only as provided by least long-term cost solutions. Optimizing investment funding levels and combinations of treatment types and timings are vital functions of any bridge management system BMS. The study addressed many unmet needs in bridge management and opened the door to significant further research and development. Many aspects of the report are now being designed into AASHTOs Pontis 5.2 BMS. Bridge managers and engineers are finding that their constituents require bridge projects and programs to perform not only as provided by least long-term cost solutions. NCHRP Project 12-67 has developed a multiple objective optimization methodology and software to facilitate implementation of balanced decision-support practices. Multicriteria methodologies were developed for the bridge decision-making problem based on the concepts of value and utility theory. Mathematical strategies were advantageously used to handle the multidimensionality of the problem in order to capture the decision makers preference structures. Network-level model aims to obtain the optimal selection of candidate projects from a networkwide candidate list. The most promising heuristics were explored and a strategy was developed that balanced theoretical precision with an appropriate level of practicality. The methodology includes a bridge-level optimization that maximizes utility by selecting from an array of scoping and timing alternatives. In many ways this is similar to AASHTOs Pontis 2 approach, with similar models for network policy optimization, bridge element deterioration, and functional improvements. Thompson, Sinha, Labi, and Patidar 197 Selecting Performance Measures. A set of performance measures for each goal clarifies the meaning of each goal. Performance measures are also sometimes referred to as attributes or criteria. A large number of performance criteria can be derived from a bridge management database. The software product of the study provides a menu of 23 different performance measures. Many are completely or partially redundant with each other so the number of measures used in practice would be far less. In any decision-making process is the need to construct, either directly or indirectly, the preference order. When multiple criteria are considered together, it is often true that no dominant alternative will exist that is better than all other alternatives. The technique is predicated on what is known as utility theory. This is based on the premise that the decision makers preference structure can be represented by a real-valued function called a utility function. Once such a function is constructed, the selection of the alternative candidates can be done by use of an optimization method. There are two general approaches for establishing utility function weights, distinguished by their context. One approach is to conduct a structured expert elicitation exercise that is intentionally removed from the context of projects and programs under consideration. Another is to experiment with the construction of real projects and Programs in an optimization process. The AHP can be used to generate an initial set of weights for the optimization model, weights that are later refined when actual programs or projects are evaluated. Much of the analytical structure was motivated by experience of the project panel and researchers in the use of AASHTOs Pontis BMS 2. Florida developed Project Level Analysis Tool PLAT 7 as an add-on to Pontis. PLAT uses the Pontis database and predictive models, but presents the results from a bridge-level perspective. The analytical architecture of the NCHRP 12-67 study divides up the analysis as in Figure 1. The analytical database is a new feature separate from the BMS, with the purpose of communicating bridge-level results asynchronously to a separate network-level programming process. Each life-cycle activity profile is modeled as an infinite time series of annual cash flows. Agency costs are concentrated in discrete interventions, each of which represents all the work done on the bridge in a given year. The significant time intervals and milestones are described in the following sections. During this period, elements on the bridge are modeled to deteriorate according to Markovian transition probabilities. Those that reach their worst condition state, and are allowed to stay there, incur a risk of unprogrammed or emergency work. At the start of 2011, the agency implements an intervention that m m First Rest Period is a period mandated by agency policy, when no action may be taken on the bridge. Deterioration of bridge elements continues, and failure risk costs may be incurred. Consequent Waiting Periods, Interventions, and Rest Periods are modeled. The end of a life-cycle activity profile, as modeled here, occurs at a point where the following year may bring either an intervention or the start or extension of a waiting period. We do not model the possibility of interventions beyond this point, however, but instead use less-detailed models to collapse all subsequent life- cycle costs into a final cash flow at the end of the analysis period. The most essential decision to be optimized in the bridge-level analysis is the scope and timing of the first intervention. Discounting makes the analysis relatively insensitive to costs that occur far in the future. The effect is enhanced by the final rest period, where a fixed period, usually 10 years, must elapse before any further intervention costs can be incurred. Do-nothing models the costs and performance of the structure if no programmed action is taken on the bridge any time during the analysis period. MRRI includes all cost-effective maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and functional improvement actions, as indicated at the time of intervention. The decision to be made by the bridge maintenance planner has two dimensions scope and timing. If the program horizon is long enough, the decision becomes a multistage process. The familiar tool of recursion provides a means to divide the problem into smaller parts. The algorithm exploits the fact that each stage of the decision tree is similar to earlier stages. The choice of intervention scope in every programming period is based on the same utility function. The structure of future consequent interventions is the same, differing only in how soon the de Tailed simulation of interventions is replaced by a less detailed long-term cost model. The optimization works in either or both of two modes Optimizing, where all program years are investigated and the one with highest utility is chosen or Worst tolerable performance WTP. If both optimization methods are chosen, the algorithm stops as soon as a performance threshold fails. At the program level, the challenge is to select a candidate from each bridge, in such a way that networkwide utility is maximized, and all cost and performance constraints are satisfied if possible. This challenge can be recognized as a special case of integer programming problems known as the knapsack problem. The program optimization problem is a Multi-Choice Multi-Dimensional Knapsack MCMDKP problem. The problem is to find the best way to optimize a bridge for a given start year.

This means that the time requirement for the optimal solution grows exponentially with the size of the problem. There are two classes of methods that exist to solve this problem exact methods and heuristics. Exact methods are guaranteed to arrive at the optimal solution but are typically associated with lower computational speeds. On the other hand, heuristic methods strive to achieve good results. The largest network we are dealing with is one with 50,000 bridges. Each bridge could have as many as five possible interventions including the do-nothing alternative. This is a huge integer programming problem, so approximate heuristic methods are very appropriate. Several heuristic methods were evaluated and tested to determine which one would give the optimal balance of accuracy and responsiveness. The algorithms selected for detailed evaluation were the IUC heuristic, the Lagrangian relaxation method 11, and the pivot-and- complement method 12. These were tested on a set of example bridge management problems, ranging from The IUC method proved to be fastest, and very close to the most accurate. It is based on the classic linear relaxation of the MCMDKP problem. Investment alternatives are arranged in decreasing order of reward to cost ratios. List B describes the trade-off between the two performance criteria that present the constraints performance and cost. List A is the underlying optimization problem that has only the budget constraint. In the event that there is no feasible solution for the given combination of budgetary and performance constraints, such lack of a solution is detected. The software products of the study include two visualization tools called digital dashboards. The bridge-level dashboard presents the current and forecast condition of a bridges elements, and any functional or structural deficiencies that might exist. For network-level analysis, the network dashboard Figure 6 presents the key trade-offs between performance and funding. The study presented a novel new combination of methods that together make up a new state-of-the-art bridge management analytical framework. The various analytical tools were shown to be compatible with each other, to make effective use of readily available data, and to be usable within a user-friendly decision support system. Major new analytical and presentation methods described in this paper have encountered widespread interest since completion of the project. The AASHTO BRIDGEWare Task Force, which oversees development of Pontis, has decided to implement most of them in release 5.2 of that product, scheduled for completion in 2009.

Rapid concrete bridge deck overlays and deck repairs in Virginia. LMC-VE overlays are being constructed at night or on weekends and opened to traffic with only 3 hours of curing. The reduced lane-closure time for construction results in construction cost savings. Eastbound lanes on Interstate 64 over the Rivanna River near Charlottesville were overlaid with two Friday-night-through-Tuesday-morning lane closures in the spring of 2006. The greater benefit is the reduction in traffic delays, fuel consumption, and accidents. A progressive degradation model was developed from a careful analysis of localized failures. A special database containing inspection records for more than 130 precast deck panel bridges in Districts 1 and 7 was created for PANEL. The Hale Boggs Bridge opened to traffic on October 5, 1983. It was the first U.S. cable- stayed crossing over the Mississippi River. The polyethylene protective sheathing was damaged in many of the cables before and during installation and after opening the bridge to traffic. The condition of 39 out of 72 cables indicated a critical need for repair. The replacement cables are being designed for a 75-year design life. The design of the complete 72-cable array replacement is the first occasion on which this process is attempted in North America. The Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge, also known as the Luling Bridge, opened to traffic October 5, 1983. It was the first cable-stayed bridge over the Mississippi River and, at the time, had the largest navigation channel span in the western hemisphere. The bridge was constructed by Williams Bros. and IHI, Inc., of Japan. Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge crosses the Mississippi River between Luling and Destrehan, Louisiana. The pylons are a modified A-shape, and the deck cross section is composed of twin 14-ft deep steel trapezoidal 215216 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference. Stay cables were prefabricated and are composed of parallel, 14-in. diameter, 240 ksi wire bundles consisting of 103, 211, 271, or 307 wires. Each wire is anchored against a steel plate by means of cold-formed button heads. On the Luling Bridge, the protective sheathing around many of the cables was damaged. Twenty-one cables required repairs before and during cable erection. Many of repairs performed before installation failed during pressure grouting. The first evidence of damage to the cable wrapping tape was detected in 1995. Subsequent inspections showed the existence of exposed and rusted stay cable wires, unplugged grout ports, extensive water leakage, cementitious grout efflorescence, and rust at the deck-level anchorage sockets. The state of the art in cable condition assessment technology and improvements in stay cable design, materials, and fabrication had changed dramatically since the bridge was designed in the 1970s. The department was motivated to extract the fullest potential service life possible for its valuable infrastructure asset, taking advantage of stay cable engineering innovations. Cable force measurement and analysis 1 showed no evidence that stay cables had suffered significant structural damage to date. Inspection of deck-level anchorages showed signs of rust and dripping water fromMehrabi, Ligozio, Ciolko, and Wyatt 219 anchorages. Stay cable arrays are susceptible to wind-induced vibrations, potentially introducing repetitive bending stresses near anchorages. Technology was needed for identifying hidden cable damage and for accessing the stay cables for their full length. A range of nondestructive testing NDT techniques were sought to augment visual inspection. Candidate NDT methods offered advantages and disadvantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, adaptability to field conditions, and cost 2. Inspection Access Considerations LaDOTD expressed interest in utilizing an inspection buggy for future inspection, maintenance, and repairs to the Luling Bridge. The buggy is capable of carrying two inspect thing and combine visual inspection, hammer sounding, and thermography. The vehicle basket is fabricated from aluminum for weight reduction advantages. The basket is attached to the lower cable of each group by a pair of rollers. Lift is provided by a hoist wire rope installed parallel to the cable, and a standard wire rope hoist attached to and operated from the basket. The inspection was completed in 9 weeks. Infrared thermography was used selectively to detect open splits in the PE cover pipes beneath the UV protection tape. Observations of main tension element steel wire were made where these were exposed by defects. Each cable, immediately above the anchorage, passes through an anchorage box within the cross girder. The cables were not accessible for direct visual inspection in this region. Broken seals and ports also had allowed water to accumulate within the cable in the transition zone and inside the sockets. Inspection of the free length discovered a variety of damage conditions in the cable-free length. These included Longitudinal and transverse splits in the PE pipe some covered by UV protection tape, and some not. Three levels of damage severity were established for cable condition rating. 224 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference protect the main tension element. Condition Level 1 encompassed cables with sound and well-functioning repairs as implemented earlier to the damaged PE pipes. Normal aging and weathering of UV protection tape, minor delamination of PE from grout filler, and light rust inside the anchorage sockets Condition Level 1 includes UV protection tape damages and nicks, grout voids, repair sleeves, PE bulges, major tape wrinkles, and moderate rust inside the anchorage sockets. Condition Level 3 encompassed ineffectively repaired and unrepaired PE splits, holes in PE pipes, exposed grout and wires. All cables, without exception, contained at least one form of damage or anomalies with Severity Level 2. Thirty-nine of 72 cables were rated as being in critical condition Level 3, with the remaining 33 cables rated as in poor condition Level 2, according to the study. Cable accelerated degradation and failure, and highest vulnerability to storm-related damage. Repair all repair free length of all cables, clean corroded sockets, and provide drainage for anchorage boxes. New repairs were assumed to be necessary every 20 years. replace option 2 replace all 39 cables rated with Severity Level 3. Repair option 1 replace all cables rated at Level 2. New repairs are assumed to be needed every 20 years. Low potential for cable failure and low vulnerability to storm-related damage are expected. Initial costs related to the installation of a monitoring system, repair, or replacement of cables. Distributedperiodic costs are related to inspection, cable force measurement, maintenance of the monitoring system and future periodic repairs. Vulnerability costs arerelated to the potential repairreplacement of cables and structural repair. In accordance with economic efficiency theory, a strategy with the lowest present value should be selected as the preferred strategy. In this case, the repair-all strategy results in the lowest total cost 12.7 million when only agency costs are accounted for. The only strategy that can be ruled out with certainty is the base case. The total cost of this strategy was considerably higher when compared to the lowest-cost strategy. LCCA of a bridge isolated from the regional highway system, though effective, cannot include or quantify all contributing cost aspects. The long-term benefits of replacing all cables outweigh the higher initial investment when compared to other strategies. The replace-all strategy presented the best value among selected strategies. Based on the bridges history and the results of the in-depth 2006 inspection, LaDOTD will extend the H. The project is the first to include the replacement of a complete stay cable array in North America. The goal at a minimum is to restore the load-carrying capacity of the bridge to its as-designed state. Cable replacement must restore load-carrying capacity of the bridge. Forces of all 72 stay cables on Luling Bridge were measured using the laser-based vibration technique. The target geometry to be created by the new stay cable array may not match the existing condition. A complete survey of the bridge superstructure was performed to establish the current state. There exist two stay systems deemed suitable for replacing the stays at the Luling crossing. Parallel wire stay cable is preferred for longer-span cable-stayed bridges. It provides a more compact stay cable with greater stiffness than the parallel strand equivalent. It is possible that no structural modifications to the bridge would be required at all if installing a similar parallel wire cable array. Piece of stay cable sheathing pipe and strand installation method has recently been made available by one stay cable supplier. It offers an alternative to be evaluated at the Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference for use on a bridge designed originally for ble-stayed bridges. The design team is evaluating feasibility of adapting the range of option. It might be possible to reduce the cable size to an equivalent strength cable. The degree of anchorage modification required will depend on the selected stay cable suppliers anchorage and stay pipe dimensions. Existing anchorage openings will need to be enlarged to accommodate the larger strand anchorages. Means are being devised to avoid enlarging the existing holes in these zones, adapting chair-like spacer assemblies. In North America, the stay cable design has evolved in 30 years from the bonded post- tensioning tendon technology. It is noted that the oldest seven-wire prestressing strand-based stay cable system in the United States is only 24 years old. PTI Cable-Stayed Bridge Committee does not recognize the sacrificial zinc layer to be one of those barriers. The transition zone between cable free length and the cable anchorage, as well as the anchorage itself, also require corrosion protection. Cable stressing can be performed strand-by-strand or by preloading the entire cable multistrand method. Single strand hydraulic rams are significantly lighter, smaller, and easier to operate than rams required for stressing the whole assembly. Wind load imparted on the bridge by the cables is a direct function of the stay cable sheathing diameter. A 3D model of the bridge has been developed to determine the response of the structure during each step of the cable replacement process. It is expected that the replacement scheme will impart minimal changes to the distribution of loads through the structure. To protect the bridge structure from excessive force variation during removal of existing cables. Temporary cables will be used to carry the dead loads and balance the forces when existing cables are removed. Temporary cables are designed for force levels determined by structural analysis and the geometry of the bridge. The system is designed to accommodate the range of stay cable angles and therefore allows for reuse of the saddle and temporary stay cable. The required size of the temporary cable will be finalized after detailed computer analysis. The temporary cables are being analyzed for wind stability. Cable security has become an increased concern for bridge owners. FHWA commissioned the Blue Ribbon Panel on Bridge and Tunnel Security. The document provides a framework for assessing the risk of a bridge. Preliminary analyses have indicated that only the free length of cable above the lower end exit point up to approximately 10 ft above deck level would generate a risk score that necessitates consideration of counter measures. This score is then compared against the cost, effectiveness, and availability of potential mitigation options to determine whether counter measures are prudent. The existing stay cables of the Luling Bridge are susceptible to wind-induced vibration. Damage to seals and scarring of PE cover pipes at cable exit points were partly attributed to the past uncontrolled vibration experiences. Vibration suppression measures will be designed. The Luling Bridge is a critical regional link, and traffic interruptions need to be as unobtrusive to the public and commerce as is practical. The MOT design is being coordinated closely with LaDOTD district and headquarters offices. The ideal scenario would be to maintain traffic on each side of the bridge during construction. This scenario will allow the ramps to remain in service, resulting in minimal disruption to local traffic. If the predominance of construction work can be accomplished within a 12 ft, 3 in. work area, then two lanes in each direction can be provided for traffic. Highline system can simplify installation of both the temporary and permanent stay cables. It will be essential for the removal of the existing stay cable. Using the highline, the stay cable can be supported at intermediate locations and lowered to the deck. Proposed sequence and the use of a highline system will allow the majority of the construction operation to be carried out within a space of about 12 ft on the right side of each bound. The highline design will be the responsibility of the contractor, who will have specific capacity requirements. The selected new stay cable array installation and construction sequence will induce force variations and deformations at the cross beam ends and the tower. It is expected that the replacement scheme will result in minimal changes to the distribution of loads throughout the structure. The final design of stay cable replacement for the Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge is the first of its kind in North America and will progress through the summer of 2008. The analysis could also limit the live load at certain stages of the construction. The stay cable array replacement project will be advertised for bid in late 2008, and it is anticipated that cable replacement will commence in early 2009. The paper summarizes the decision process for selecting cable replacement as a means for extending the bridges service life. Structural Performance, Monitoring, and Remaining Life. Development and Verification of a NDT Method for Detection of Flaws in PE Sheathing of Stay Cables. Recommendations for Stay Cable Design, Testing and Installation. BPP are to collect, document, and make available high-quality quantitative performance data on a representative sample of bridges nationwide. The collected data will be used to develop greater knowledge regarding bridge performance and degradation. There remains a lack of reliable, cost-effective, long-term monitoring devices capable of determining the structural stability of bridge piers. This paper will present the results of efforts to utilize an array of low-cost tilt sensors. The application of such monitoring devices and how they integrate with overall bridge management strategies will be discussed. Scour occurs when flowing water removes material from around bridge piers. This creates scour holes beneath footings that can jeopardize the stability of the bridge. Other hazards, such as erosion and unexpected settlement, can also result in a loss of subsurface support. Tilt sensors have been proposed and are currently utilized in systems intended to monitor short-term events. These systems frequently include a limited number of tilt sensors, due to cost and other 238Washer, Masterson, Philipps, and Fuchs 239 considerations. The system is being developed to measure both changes in rotation tilt as well as vertical displacement of a pier. The sensors are deployed in a high-density array, such that multiple-sensor outputs can be integrated to eliminate erroneous readings. The system being developed employs electrolytic tilt sensors for monitoring the tilt of a bridge pier and structural displacements. Electrolytic sensors were selected over a microelectro- mechanical systems-based technology due to their greater stability and precision. Lab testing has been conducted using a custom-designed 32-channel data acquisition system developed by Fuchs Consulting, Inc. The system supplies the power to the tilt sensors, logs the output from the sensors at a specified rate, provides temperature measurements, and offers a computer interface for analyzing data. A test bridge has been designed and constructed on which the sensors can be mounted. The project involved characterizing the electrolytic tilt sensors. Testing was completed to calibrate the sensors as well as determine the sensor noise, warm-up periods, temperature effects, and resolution. The voltage output was recorded using the data acquisition system. The calibration factors for electrolytic tilt sensors vary with temperature due to the changing viscosity of the fluid within the sensor. The temperature compensation factor accounts for the change in calibration factor as the temperature varies. In order to verify this factor, a test was completed in which the rotary stage was placed in a temperature chamber. The minimum resolution of the system was found to be no more than 28 arcseconds 0.0077. The nominal temperature compensation factor is acceptable for use in postprocessing. Other tests have also been run in order to characterize the sensors. Among these were tests to evaluate drift and identify noise levels. Algorithms under development to achieve the following: initial filtration, calibration, and temperature compensation, movement computation, determination of sensor consistency, sensor correlation, and critical movement identification. The use of multiple sensors allows one to achieve measurement redundancy. The initial filter has been developed to address errant readings that are consistent among all of the channels. Errant data points that occur in individual channels are addressed in algorithms to test sensor consistency within the sensor array. The filter was developed by utilizing the 3 Sigma Edit Rule.  filter only considers then nearest 48 points when computing the median and median absolute deviation from the median. Detected outliers are replaced in the data set using a median value from nearby points. This method was chosen over replacement with an average or neighboring point in order to account for situations when the data vary greatly or when two consecutive points are deemed outliers.  filter has been shown to detect upwards of 99 of the noise spikes. It is designed to error on the side of false positive readings rather than leaving noise spikes undetected. The noise spikes are eliminated, thus resulting in no inaccurate movement calculations in future postprocessing. The system is sensitive to both instant and gradual tilts. Algorithms have been completed to assess tilt data over 1 h, 12 h, 24 h, 7 days, 28 days, and 90 days. In order to determine the magnitude and direction of pier movements, the programmed algorithms compute the change in tilt over a set time integral using vector comparison. To determine the movement over a set time period, a normal vector is compared to that from the end of the time period. The angle between the two normal vectors is computed based on Equation 2 below. The resulting theta is the magnitude of the change in tilt over that time period in degrees. The system is currently setup such that Sensors 2, 3, and 4 form an array on one side of the pier, while Sensors 5, 6, and 7 form anarray on the opposite side. The sensors are configured in this way so that each side of. the pier has three sensors in order to achieve sensor redundancy. The algorithms first check for errant readings in each sensor individually. Once each sensor is checked individually, sets of sensors are considered. Within each set, an average movement is determined. Each sensors tilt movement is then compared with that average. If any movement varies more than a set threshold from that average, a sensor inconsistency exists. The output furthest from the average belongs to the inconsistent sensor. Figure 9 contains direct output from MATLAB in which one sensor in a set is inconsistent. If the sensors are found to be inconsistent for a certain percentage of the data, a message is sent to the user stating that the sensors in the set are inconsistent and further review is necessary. The algorithms detect that irregularity and a message is given to the user reporting that Sensor 4 is inconsistent for a 1-day period and will be disregarded in further processing. Once all inconsistencies are identified, the remaining sensors in the array are averaged in order to determine one value for the movement of the array. This process is completed for each array. The system is designed with two sensor arrays, one on each side of the pier. In order to ensure consistency between the sets, a method is used in which the difference between the two sides outputs is computed and compared to a predetermined threshold. Once the sets are shown to be consistent with one another, they are combined to determine an overall movement. The program will record movements computed over six different time integrals. The directions from each set are translated to a universal coordinate system and averaged. An overall direction of the tilt of the pier is recorded for each time step as well as the magnitude of that movement. The goal of this project is to develop and implement a system of tilt sensors capable of monitoring the long-term motion of bridge piers. The system will be implemented on a bridge in New York State for final testing. In addition, model data will be created in order to further test the programs effectiveness with long- term gradual movements. Algorithm development included utilizing multisensor reasoning in order to program initial filtration, calibration and temperature compensation, movement computation, determination of sensor consistency, sensor correlation, and critical movement identification. Movements were computed over several different time integrals so the system can detect instantaneous events such as scour. The system will act as a tool for long-term asset management. It will allow owners to monitor remotely the behavior of a bridge over many years. The placement of sensors in arrays allows for a more accurate model of the pier movement. As rail infrastructure networks deteriorate and the demands upon them change, it is important for decision makers to have a sound objective overview of their rail network. This objective view can be obtained by conducti The components to be included in a technical audit, with respect to the description of existing infrastructure and the evaluation of past performance, are presented. A s an infrastructure network deteriorates and the demands upon it change, it is important for the people responsible for it to have a sound objective view. This objective view can be obtained by conducting an audit. There are many different components that can be included in an audit. The ones that should be included depend on the specific objectives of the audit. This article confines itself to technical audits, defined to have the following general objectives.  identification of all infrastructure objects to be included in the audit and the determination of their extent, is required as it is the basis for the audit. Extent can be measured in number of objects and in terms of other units more representative of the significance of the infrastructure objects. An example for bridges is shown in Table 2 using the number and surface area of the bridges. Adey and Hajdin 251 Requirements As it is rarely reasonable to take into consideration all of the infrastructure objects individually, an infrastructure model must be constructed. The model used depends on the specific objectives of the audit, the accuracy and precision. It is useful to use the same model throughout the audit. Existing infrastructure models must be checked for their suitability for use in an audit. An infrastructure model is not suitable if it cannot be used to provide sufficiently accurate future predictions. When this assumption cannot be made, the relationships between the multiple infrastructure objects must be taken into consideration. One example is the collapse of a retaining wall. It is not possible to estimate the consequences of the collapse without taking into consideration the possibility of deviating trains on other links. An infrastructure model is not suitable if it is will not yield sufficiently precise future predictions. For example, if under the previously defined general objective to predict future performance, one of the specific objectives is to estimate future intervention costs. It may be possible to achieve very accurate cost estimates for concrete bridges that are equal to or over 20 m in length if the number of columns, abutments, and deck slabs as well as their sizes are known. If this data, however, is not readily available, then such data may take years of work to collect. Such a model would render such a model unsuitable. The structures infrastructure is divided into four general object types based on object function a bridges, b tunnels, c retaining walls, and d soil structures. Bridges are divided into groups based on their principal material of construction, and concrete bridges are divide into groups depending on their length. The most detail that can achieved with the model shown in Figure 1 is to be able to make statements Adey and Hajdin 253 Location Reason The determination of infrastructure location is often necessary in order to have an overview of the role of the infrastructure in the network. The grouping of infrastructure according to properties that can be expected to vary based on geographic locations often increases the accuracy of future predictions. The speed of gradual deterioration of infrastructure. The likelihood of occurrence of sudden deterioration due to events, such as natural hazards. The ability to access the infrastructure to perform interventions. s to consider depends on the specific objectives of the audit. An example display of infrastructure location is shown in Figure 2, using a classification that results in four bridge types. The surface area of the infrastructure per type is given as a pie chart per segment, e.g., on the upper left most line segment there are 12,000 m2 of concrete bridges. Infrastructure is often grouped by zone or line segment, or using linear referencing along a segment. The most significant problem with the determination of infrastructure location is the availability of data. If exact location data already exist in database systems then it can be determined for an audit quickly, precisely and accurately.  astructure value is necessary so that the significance of infrastructure objects can be compared. There are different ways to measure value 7 and the relevancy of each depends on the objectives of the audit. Two of the most common ways are a the current replacement value, and b the use value.  current replacement value is the cost of replacing an infrastructure object today, either with or without the demolition costs of the old infrastructure. The estimation of use value requires the estimation of the benefits of the users because of the existence of the infrastructure object. It is only possible to make these assumptions for infrastructure networks in a limited number of cases. If these assumptions are not possible the use of use value will give erroneous results. An example of bridge value, in tabular form, for bridge infrastructure is shown in Table 2. It can be seen that masonry rail bridges comprise ap The use of value becomes particularly useful when fundamentally different infrastructure objects are to be compared, e.g., track and bridges. A potential problem that occurs in the estimation of the value of infrastructure is the use of market values when they do not exist. The assessment of the physical condition of the infrastructure is normally required to provide a basis from which to predict future costs. The assessment of physical condition to evaluate past agency costs is discussed in the section entitled past performance. It is often beneficial to group the deterioration processes into two categories. For infrastructure that appears to be deteriorating gradually, condition states can be used to rate the condition of the object or its components, for example scales such as 1 to 5 or failed to excellent. Infrastructure that deteriorates suddenly, i.e., infrastructure where scheduled inspections cannot determine the advancement of the deterioration of the physical condition, can be considered to be in a condition For infrastructure that appears to be deteriorating suddenly, age and operating conditions can be used to assess physical condition. For example, if a piece of signalization equipment is 17 years old and its life expecates to be 17 years, it may have a condition state of 2.33 3 3 2 23. An example display of the condition of four infrastructure types can be seen in Figure 3. In this example, condition is ranked in five categories of increasing physical damage. The average condition of each infrastructure per type is given as a pie chart per segment. Condition states are best defined in reference to physical condition alone. It is then easy to establish guidelines as to what condition the infrastructure object is in. When other criteria are used, such as time to intervention, judgment is required with respect to the action that needs to be taken. The definition of condition states should be consistent across infrastructure object types. For example, if catenaries are divided into three condition states and Concrete bridges Masonry bridges Metal bridges Composite bridges Very good 1.5 Good 2.5 Acceptable 3.5 Poor 4.5 Alarming. The number of trains that were supposed to travel on each line segment, and the number of passengers that were expected to be carried can be used as indicators of the inadequate performance of infrastructure. The simple statistics are, however, often not enough to definitively state if there was inadequate infrastructure per se. The statistics often need to be coupled with an explanation of the problem source, e.g., train speed reduced from 120 kmh to 40 kmh due to uncertainty of bridge load carrying capacity. An example display of four infrastructure use indicators can be seen in Figure 4. Use indicators can be combined if it will be of use in the identification of infrastructure problems, for example, tons of goods, and train speed. A potential problem with determining infrastructure use indicators is to capture everything that the infrastructure is currently being used for, and to structure the indicators in the best way to help identify past performance problems. The evaluation of past infrastructure performance depends on the past costs of infrastructure use with respect to a base case. In order to effectively complete this part of an audit it is often necessary to rely on indicators of past additional costs. Agency costs can be grouped into those resulting from a change in the behavior of people, i.e., labor costs, and changes resulting from the environment,i.e. material costs. As it is difficult to separate agency labor and material costs, they are normally grouped together and treated as one. Infrastructure condition coupled with past expenditures can be used as an indicator. Use of materials has a cost both to the agency or the user and the general public. All costs and indicators of costs are past values. Injuries and deaths are considered to have a co-occurrence. Adey and Hajdin: Infrastructure condition or past expenditure alone, except in extreme cases, provides little information with respect to past infrastructure performance. Neither infrastructure condition nor expenditures are expected to be constant from construction until the end of use. Users have costs due to the inadequate performance of infrastructure. An indicator of negative economic impact is delays and number of derailments. Indicators of the negative environmental impact are past material consumption, noise levels, and pollution levels. The evaluation of past performance often requires the combination of the performance indicators. The use of technical serviceability indicators as performance indicators is a problem. Without a direct correlation to the additional costs incurred due to inadequate performance it is difficult if not impossible to compare results between infrastructure object types. Indicators should be chosen to reflect costs. 262 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference. There are many different components to be included in an audit. This article confined itself to technical audits, defined to have the following general objectives. Risk is defined as the probability of occurrence of inadequate infrastructure performance multiplied by the consequences. d, along with the requirements of the component for its inclusion in an audit and a statement of some of the potential problems. IBSMC08-032: Structural instrumentation-based monitoring is a useful tool for health monitoring, inspection, maintenance, and safety assurance. Real-time, in- service performance measurements provide invaluable information. A properly designed monitoring system can provide real-time performance data. For a complex structure, performance information may be a more useful and cost-effective inspection tool. Dial-out capabilities can be incorporated into a system to provide immediate alerts if measured data exceed predetermined thresholds. A video-based system is being developed to alert bridge owners of barge impacts and help identify offending barges. Measured performance data can also be used to reduce maintenance costs. Structural monitoring is often used to evaluate the in-service performance of new materials. The George Washington Bridge is a two-level suspension bridge that crosses the Hudson River between upper Manhattan, New York, and Fort Lee, New Jersey. The GWB has a total of 592 wire rope suspenders that were installed in 1931 and have been in service for more than 75 years. Each floor beam is supported by two pairs of suspenders, or eight wire ropes at each end. The wire ropes transfer the bridge loads from the main floor beams to four main suspension cables. In 2005, the validated NDT technique was performed on a total of 283 rope legs. This presentation describes the procedures followed to determine the remaining life and deterioration rates of the suspenders. Engineers and managers of long-span suspension bridges will find the discussions and results presented very useful. Highway construction is unavoidable, but excessive construction time should be avoided. Transportation agencies are committed to offering motorists high-quality, longer-lasting highways and bridges. Front-burner priorities are to stem the annual loss of more than 40,000 lives to accidents. Presentation will cover what is accelerated bridge construction and innovative use of prefabricated systems. The attendees will learn about the state-of-the practice information relative to means, methods, details, and criteria that have been used and proven successful. Once fatigue cracks have been detected in a steel bridge, the possibilities for rehabilitation, in particular, may be limited. One possible method of rehabilitating structures such as these that has received recent attention is the application of adhesively bonded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer CFRP overlays. This approach has a number of potential advantages. Experimental and analytical studies will be presented on the effectiveness of high-modulus CFRP overlays in increasing the fatigue lives of notched steel plates. Crack mouth opening displacements will be measured and the crack lengths will be monitored. The findings of this work will provide valuable insight regarding the usage of CFRP to extend the fatigue lives of existing steel bridges. Advances in structural adhesives have permitted engineers to contemplate the use of bonded joints in areas that have long been dominated by mechanical fasteners and welds. Bonded composite repair technology has made great strides in commercial aviation use. This paper presents the application of high-modulus, fiber-reinforced polymer FRP composite patches to repair a steel bridge on Interstate 10. The goal of this pilot program is to eliminate any obstacles to the use of composite doubler repairs. The factors influencing the durability of composite patches in severe field environments will be discussed along with related laminate design, analysis, installation, and nondestructive inspection issues. Current techniques for strengthening steel structures have several drawbacks, including requiring heavy equipment for installation. Instead of fastening multiple steel plates to implement a repair, it is possible to bond a single fiber-reinforced polymer FRP composite doubler. In the wake of the August 2008 Interstate bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a wide range of concerns has arisen over bridges and other civil structures that are being used beyond their initial design lifetime. These concerns are heightened by the fact that many of these structures undergo minimal, and possibly inadequate, inspections. The effect of structural aging and the dangerous combination of fatigue, corrosion  Mechanically fastened repairs involve the addition of new holes with associated stress risers and new crack initiation sites. The time and labor involved to attach such repairs can be prohibitive. Both bolted and welded repairs have inferior crack mitigation capabilities. This investigation proved the effectiveness of composite materials to strengthen damaged or deficient steel structures. This research program developed and proved an optimum field installation process. By encompassing all cradle-to-grave tasksincluding design, analysis, installation, structural integrity, and inspection, this program is designed to firmly establish the capabilities of composite doub The number of plies and fiber orientation are determined by the nature of the reinforcement required. The taper at the edge of the doubler is used to produce a gradually increasing stress gradient in the area of primary load transfer. A top ply of fiberglass is installed to supply mechanical and environmental protection for the installation.  composite doublers offer enhanced safety through improved fatigue life and corrosion resistance. The engineering advantages of composite doubler repairs include a elimination of fastener holes or weld stress risers that produce new crack initiation sites. Bonded composite doublers can be used in lieu of mechanically fastened metallic patches to reinforce or repair damaged structures. The economic advantages include rapid repair installations that reduce downtime and do not require future maintenance. Composite doubler repair applications can include such diverse structures as auto and rail bridges, trains and subway vehicles, ships and naval vessels, buildings, electric nuclear power plants, energy generation equipment, aerospace vehicles, transmission towers, manufacturing factories, pressure vessels, tanker trucks, military vehicles and structures. Roach, Rackow, Delong, and Franks 273 Fatigue Crack at Subway Door Corner. Applications for composite doubler repairstrains and subway vehicles, ships and naval vessels, trucks, and mining equipment. Even modest gains in the efficiency of construction and repair could yield huge overall savings. The American Society of Civil Engineers ASCE issued a report on the status of the U.S. infrastructure. Figure 6 shows two bridge failuresin Montreal and Connecticut. On August 1, 2007, an I-35 bridge crossing the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, failed. Figure 7 shows a bridge with a large fatigue crack that was discovered and repaired. The Minneapolis event is being described as a structural failure and not an act of terrorism. In Ontario, Canada, 187 bridges missed safety inspections in 2006. Ontario only finished 36 million of 210 million in bridge repairs needed in the provinces Golden Horseshoe area. Bonded composite doubler repairs can extend fatigue life by a factor of 100 while allowing little or no crack growth in a parent steel structure. Doublers may reduce stress levels below crack onset and growth conditions such that the flaw is completely arrested. The boronepoxy doubler was able to return the parent structure to its original strength and load carrying capability. Figure 8 shows the I-10 bridge and highlights the bridge construction around the damaged region. Roach, Rackow, Delong, and Franks 277 Damaged Region I-Beam Propagating Fatigue Cracks a Direction of Traffic Cross-Brace Diaphragm Fatigue Crack on Left Side of Diaphagm Fatique Crack on Right Side I- beam of NM Rt28 Avenidade Mesilla Southside. The I-beam to be repaired was 0.5 in. thick. The large holes visible in the web of the I- beam are stop-drills that were added in unsuccessful attempts to arrest the growth of the fatigue cracks. A set of 16 strain gages were used to monitor the strain risers around the crack tips and holes. A critical element in producing field repairs of this nature is the ability to produce sufficient temperatures in the structure to complete the hot-bonding process. Flanges, structural attachments, and other heat sinks that can remove heat from the repair area exacerbate this problem. Preliminary tests were conducted to determine if the number, size, power, and arrangement of heat blankets were necessary. The optimal composite doubler repair would be part of an overall repair method that also includes a weld process. Heat lamps were used to warm the bottom flange of the I-beam and the web area immediately adjacent to the repair region. The required number of plies and the transfer length, y xy xy which defines the overall repair length, were calculated. An iterative process was then followed whereby specific design parameters were adjusted in an effort to meet general design guidelines. Doubler design notes 45-degree plies provide better performance in shear loads. Use of corner angles reduces stress riser at steel-doubler interface. Adding width improves load transfer into doubler and decreases bypass strain. Increasing taper ratio reduces peel stresses.  UV rays from the sun will break down an epoxy resin system over time and result in boron fiber loss. The basic composite doubler installation steps are as follo. sistance, and ultraviolet UV protection. UV protection 8.00 8.75 4X1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.250 0.280 0.00 13.875 13.00 12.50 12.00 11.50 11. Paint removal and coarse sanding to remove oxide layers, grit blasting to produce a proper and uniform surface roughness, application of silane and primer to enhance the chemical bond, and application of controlled heat to cure the boronepoxy doubler and the adhesive. Figures 10 and 11 provide aRoach, Rackow, Delong, and Franks 281.  composite doublers placed on both sides of the cracked I-beam, vacuum bag, and heat blanket set-up. Five heat blankets were used to produce the cure temperatures and 16 thermocouples were mounted around the repair region to provide the closed-loop feedback to the hot bonder machines. A successful wedge test result is achieved when adhesive material appears on both the metal substrate and the witness coupon. A post-repair strain mapping was conducted after the composite doubler installation to compare strain fields before and after repairing the crack. Strain readings showed that after the composite repair process, the stress risers associated with the cracks were eliminated. Maximum longitudinal stress levels ranged from 4,000 to 4,500 psi. Principal stress levels away from the damaged region reached a maximum value of 4,600 psi. The lateral stress levels were reduced significantly. Sandia Lab research program evolved the application of composite patches to refurbish thick steel structures typically used in civil and military structures. Instead of riveting multiple metal plates or using welding processes to facilitate a repair, it is possible to bond a single composite doubler to the damaged structure. Current techniques for strengthening steel structures have several drawbacks. The use of bonded composite doublers overcomes the difficulties associated with current repair techniques. This study showed that bonded composite repairs have crack mitigation capabilities that are superior to bolted and welded repairs. Stress monitoring before and after the repair showed that the composite repair will arrest crack growth in the bridge I-beam. rapid repair installations that reduce downtime and do not require future maintenance. This new repair process was successfully demonstrated on a steel highway bridge. Roach, D. P. and K. Rackow.

Corrosion and corrosion-related tendon failures have been disclosed on several segmental box girder bridges in Florida. Corrosion of post-tensioned tendon is suspected in several other post- tensioned bridges. S teel structures exposed to soil and water corrode from the first day they are placed in service. The rate of corrosion depends on the availability of water and oxygen in alkaline environments. In acidic environments, corrosion ca ca. When steel is placed in a high pH environment such as concrete or grout, it does not corrode. This is primarily due to the formation of a film on the surface of steel. U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety 1 regulations expressly prohibit operating a coated pipeline without any cathodic protection. Carbonation is a process where carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reacts with calcium hydroxide in concrete or grout to form calcium carbonate. This chemical reaction reduces the pH and causes the dissolution of the passive film. Water and fines in the grout have a tendency to separate and move ahead of thegrout mass. This results in voids and low pH grout around the tend The majority of post-tensioned structures are still functioning under full design loads without any problems. Any section loss due to corrosion can significantly overstress the remaining wiresstrands and can lead to structural failure without any warning sign. In other structures e.g., VarinaEnon Bridge in Virginia, past routine investigations identified voids. It was assumed that if voids were completely filled, there would be no further corrosion. 3 years later one of the tendons was completely severed due to severe corrosion. This clearly indicated that actively corroding tendons would continue to corrode. There is a general tendency to limit corrosion evaluation to evidence of corrosion, voids in the grout, or broken wires. There are several limitations to this line of thinking. For example, a bore scope can be inserted only if voids are greater than a certain size. The author has investigated the corrosion condition of several post-tensioned structures. Based on his experience, voids are more common than expected. Identifying and filling voids with high-quality grout may not arrest corrosion but in fact may accelerate corrosion and strand failures. The tendons that hold the boxes together are inside the web walls of the box girder. Each tendon is made up of several spirally wound, 12- to 58-in. diameter, seven-wire strands. The quality of the grout may influence the rate of corrosion of strands. The owner prudently embarked on a thorough investigation to quantify the level of corrosion and not just identify corrosion. Testing involved exposing the tendons, documenting the visual condition of the wiresstrands, including the degree of rusting and pitting. Grout samples were extracted for chloride and petrographic analysis. A thin layer of grout on the surface of the strands can actually hold this moisture and increase the duration that the strands experience corrosion. It is important to measure the rate of corrosion of strands while it is still covered by grout. The corrosion potential varied from a low of 263 mV CSE may or may not have active corrosion. Grout samples taken from various test locations were immediately sealed in a zip lock bag at the site and transported to the laboratory for further testing. The chloride content of the grout samples ranged from a low of 0.0051 to a high of0.0127 by weight of cement. The alkalinity of the Grout varied from 9 to 13 along the strand. At select locations i.e., cou SCS measured the rate of corrosion of strands in-situ to capture the ongoing corrosion. Overall corrosion rate varied from as low as 0.01 mpy very low to as high as 1.9 mpy high. Seven out of 30 tendons 23 indicated a high 1 mpy corrosion rate. At least some of the voids in the ducts can be attributed to the occurrence of bleeding in the grout. Presence of voids and white chalky grout also points to bleeding. Rate of corrosion of strands varies significantly from location to location. The rate of corrosion combined with past corrosion damage can help determine the time to criticality. Rate of corrosion measurement can delineate areas of concern within the structure."

The FHWA uses the National Bridge Investment Analysis System NBIAS to develop its estimates of bridge investment needs for the CP Report. The system predicts the structural elements, including the quantity and condition of each element, for each bridge in the NBI. Once a bridge inventory has been established, the system uses a modeling approach originally adapted from the Pontis Bridge Management System When performing an analysis, the system executes a series of simulations with different annual budgets. Default deterioration models have been developed for each of the nine climate zones through a separate effort. Functional improvements may be triggered either through a functional improvement policy matrix or by any functional issue that results in a deduction in the sufficiency rating.  functional improvements are considered needs if the benefit of making an improvement over a specified analysis period exceeds the improvement cost. Replacement of a bridge may be triggered because replacement is the most cost-effective means to address a preservation or functional improvement need. Engineering rules may be specified based on bridge age, health index, sufficiency rating. FHWA reports on the condition of the bridge network, and on investment needs for bridges, in the biannual Conditions and Performance CP Report. The FHWA uses the computer model National Bridge Investment Analysis System NBIAS to perform its analysis of bridge investment needs. NBIAS requires only the National Bridge Inventory NBI data reported annually to FHWA by each state. Pontis requires element-level data for its modeling. NBIAS has a number of features to support network-level analyses. NBIAS models preservation and functional improvement needs for each bridge in a network. The system uses data on current conditions to predict conditions over time and determine the optimal allocation of resources. This section describes the NBIAS modeling approach. Robert and Gurenich 299 The motivation for the screening procedure is that once a bridge is imported into the system it is assumed that the bridge should be maintained in a state of good repair. If the disbenefit of removing a bridge from service to the cost of replacing the bridge. is less than the replacement cost by a specified factor, the bridge is screened from further analysis. If this parameter is missing or 0, then the default value of 1 is used. NBI data have been imported into the NBIAS database. The system uses a set of models called synthesis, quantity, and condition SQC models. SQC models evaluate information about a bridge from the bridges NBI record, and estimate or synthesize which structural elements would exist based on a mix of engineering and stochastic rules. Once the likely elements are identified, the quantity of the element that one would expect to find on a bridge is estimated. NBIAS models only the AASHTO Commonly Recognized CoRe elements 7. The objective of the preservation models is to find the optimal preservation policy for each bridge element. Delaying a recommended action under optimal policy is costly in the long run. In NBIAS the preservation decision-making process is treated as a Markov decision problem MDP. The net benefit of taking the recommended action is calculated as the difference in the life-cycle cost of the element if action is deferred for 1 year and if the optimal action is taken. NBIAS applies two sets of business rules a functional improvement policy and a set of rules derived from the process of calculating sufficiency rating and structural deficiency. The user may choose to use one or both sets of rules. The second set of business rules is unique to NBIAS. Any functional issue that results in a deduction in sufficiency rating, or that. results in classification of a bridge as SD or FO, triggers a potential need. The following conditions cause identification of a potential widening need. Deck geometry rating NBI Item 68 is less than 6 Underclearances rating N BI Item 69 is less. than 6 as A potential bridge strengthening need is identified if the inventory rating NBI Item 66 is less than 32.4 metric tons. Once a potential need has been identified, the next step is to determine whether it is feasible to perform the improvement on the bridge. The feasibility of the potential improvement is also driven by a set of business rules. NBIAS replacement rules are conceptually similar to rules defined in Pontis 10. The replacement rules in NBIAS differ in that they may be used to trigger only one action, replacement. The next step in the process is to identify the cost of the potential improvement. NBIAS supports two different models for calculation of functional improvement benefits. Pontis models 8 and more recently developed Florida Department of Transportation FDOT models tha. on the following concepts302 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference Widening needs are evaluated based on the reduction of accidents on the bridge. Raising and strengthening needs are evaluation based NBIAS uses user cost parameters e.g. value of time, vehicle operating costs, crash costs adapted from the HERS model parameters. Once the costs and benefits of a potential functional improvement need have been calculated, NBIAS evaluates whether the bridge is still a candidate for improvement. If R is greater than or equal to the specified threshold, the project becomes a candidate for consideration in the program simulation. Once a project is considered as a candidate, its 1-year benefits and incremental BC ratio are calculated and the candidate competes for funding with other project candidates. NBIAS uses an IBC approach to simulate selection of projects year by year. The objective is to maximize agency and user benefits. NBIAS applies the recommendations of the preservation policy and functional improvement models to the bridge population. NBIAS simulates the effect of project selection on over 200 measures of effectiveness. The system performs one run using a user-specified budget for each analysis period. NBIAS then performs N 1 simulations, in addition to the first simulation described above. When parameterization is done by the cutoff BC ratio, the user specifies the upper and lower limits for the cut-off ratio, and the number of parametric steps. NBIAS then runs the simulation assuming an unlimited budget, and stops allocating funds upon reaching project alternatives with BC ratios below the cutoff. NBIAS predicts 206 measures of effectiveness MOEs. These are grouped into eight categories, as detailed below. Needs measures are reported by the type of work needed to meet the need. In calculating needs, the system sums the cost of all of the work that would be recommended. Most needs are structurallyfunctionally motivated needs. Economically motivated needs, which are exclusively bridge replacements, are reported for the sake of completeness. Work and backlog measures are closely related to needs. They represent the work that would actually be performed given a particular budget level. NBIAS reports two types of benefits obtained and potential. Obtained benefits are the benefits NBIAS simulates as occurring during a program simulation. Potential benefits are benefits that could be obtained if there were no budget constraints or no BC cutoff. FHWA defines condition ratings for deck, superstructure, and substructure conditions in the NBI Coding Guide 3. These ratings, referred to in the system as NBI condition ratings, are based on a scale from 0 to 9. NBIAS calculates the number of bridges and the percentage of deck area classified as SD or FO based on FHWA guidelines. A series of MOEs is used to report the average sufficiency rating. The analytical module allows the user to define models and run budget scenarios. NBIAS architecture. for analysis. It pulls data from the database Arrow 2, generates a scenario, and stores the results back in the database. A second module, the what-if analysis module, provides a variety of interactive views and reports which allow the user to see the results. NBIAS results are displayed through a series of interactive views in the what-if analysis module. For example, one may specify a MOE, an asset group, and a time period. Transition probabilities and the resulting model are shown at the bottom of the screen. NBIAS offers a comprehensive modeling approach for analyzing highway bridge investment needs at a network level. Key strengths of the system are its reliance on a fundamental approach first introduced by Pontis. A number of U.S. states have used NBIAS for performing network-level needs analysis. The tool is well suited for this purpose. Particularly if a state lac NBIAS may represent the most readily available system in the United States to support bridge investment analysis. Despite these features, NBIAS is not a replacement for a BMS. It has no functionality for supporting the bridge inspection process. The system optimizes preservation actions based on the assumption that future decisions will be optimal. In cases where funding is constrained and an agencys practices differ from the optimal model, the solution identified by the model for any one year may be suboptimal. The system does not account for the effects of scour on bridges. More research is needed into the modeling of risk of bridge failure conditions. Currently the potential for failure is handled in only a rudimentary way. The authors wish to acknowledge the FHWA Office of Legislative and Governmental Affair.

This paper describes some of the potential means of leveraging bridge data from the design stage for more aspects of the life cycle. The intent is to demonstrate the viability of integrated bridge project delivery and life-cycle management. The paper provides an update on current FHWA-funded research on this subject. Advances in automation and communication technologies in recent years have been significant, but they have not yet been fully adapted and integrated with each other. In the absence of industrywide nonproprietary standards for the representation and exchange of life-cycle bridge data, this paper describes and demonstrates some of the potential means and benefits of leveraging bridge data from the design stage. The intent is to demonstrate the viability of integrated bridge project delivery and life- cycle management via a prototype integrated system. U.S. practice of information transfer during the bridge planning, design, fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance processes involves repeated manual transcription of data. FHWA sponsorship to develop a program to explore the promise of parametric 3-D bridge information modeling BrIM. The purpose of this FHWA project is to explore the promise of parametric 3-D BrIM as an enabling technology. nfluence of various then-emerging automation and communication technologies to support bridge management functions. The vision of this project is to facilitate the development of an integrated system for the entire bridge life cycle, i.e., from cradle to grave. All three fundamental objectives of bridge delivery, namely higher quality, faster delivery, and more economical cost will then be attained. Shirolé, Chen, and Puckett 315: A coordinated shepherding of data supporting these individual applications would be more easily maintained. Hand-off processes from one application to another would be streamlined if not made altogether seamless. The bridge data that is inherited by the bridge owner upon completion of the construction of the bridge is taken herein as the logical starting point for subsequent updating. These bridge operations and management aspects, as distinct from the design and construction aspects shown in Figure 1, are the principal focus of this paper. Shirolé, Chen, and Puckett 317 Bridge Operations Load Rating Load rating of bridges constitutes a central recurrent task during the operations phase of the bridge life cycle. The starting point for the bridge model suitable to drive load rating processes can be the bridge models inherited from the design and construction stages. Having the same model shared between design checking and load rating is a significant advantage. Bridge data e.g., girder section data, material properties need not be re-entered in order to conduct load rating. Multiple copies of such data do not proliferate. Having XML-based or BridgeWare API-based linkage software facilitates the execution of this load rating exercise. It avoids tedious time-consuming error-prone bridge data re-entry where such is not needed. The software applications dealing with such requests rely not only upon the very same bridge data used for a bridge rating calculation but also upon the following Software application capabilities. By linking, such functionality would enable the following aspects of the routingpermitting work flow online application for permit vehicle. Figure 7 shows resulting vehicle routing selection courtesy of AASHTOWare. The records management burden associated with maintaining biennial bridge inspection data is significant. The Pontis software provides software support at the project level for these data via the BridgeWare database. The overall bridge life cycle information management framework envisioned in Figure 1 would need to evolve with it. In this segment project-level bridge inspection data management would be found support for, e.g., National Bridge Inventory condition ratings report generation. Data-level support eliminates the need for software interoperability architectures in this particular portion of the envisioned integrated environment. For example, access to the network-level bridge inspection condition and rating load- carrying capacity information would support the decision-making needs. Network-level bridge needs are being considered not just based upon condition, but also in terms of their vulnerabilities to catastrophic failure. As a result, the BM systems capabilities are being enhanced. The rapid advances in the automation and communications technologies will continue their march. Real-time audio- visual communications and real-time monitoring capabilities will further aid timely management actions. One can expect that this proof-of-concept FHWA project will have paved the way to a truly comprehensive and cost-effective approach.

The National Bridge Inventory NBI database is an extensive source of information on highway bridges in the United States. Among more than 100 NBI elementsdeck, superstructure, substructure, and culverts condition ratings are of special interest for bridge engineers and managers. The NBI Translator is one of the algorithms that have been developed to achieve that goal. Recently, there has been some concern on the degree of accuracy of this algorithm. The paper concludes with a discussion on how to improve the algorithm. As the infrastructure gets older, more resources are required to maintain it at an acceptable level of service. Unlike pavements, the failure of bridge structures may result in disasters. Biannual National Bridge Inventory NBI rating is an effort to su Modeling NBI ratings from the detailed element-level condition data has been a 324Aldemir-Bektas and Smadi 325 topic of interest. There have been efforts but the degree of efficiency of the models is a discussion subject. The 1968 Federal-Aid Highway Act put the states in action to collect and keep an inventory for federal-aid highway system bridges. In general, bridges are inspected every 2 years, and the condition ratings are reported to the FHWA. The failure of the Mianus River Bridge, Connecticut, in 1983 and Schoharie Creek Bridge, New York, in 1987 were other two unfortunate events after The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required the states to develop and implement BMSs. Decisions on the distribution of federal funding through programs such as Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program are based on these reports. Pontis 8 is the most commonly used BMS in the United States. A few states preferred to develop their own BMSs Pennsylvania, Alabama, New York, and North Carolina. The State of Maine implemented BRIDGIT. Pontis keeps track of current condition, simulates future condition, identifies bridge- and network-level needs and makes project recommendations. Not all states benefit from the tool for resource allocation and identifying future projects. The Structure Inventory and Appraisal Sheet lists the NBI items necessary for inspecting individual structures. NBI condition rating for an element is an evaluation of its current condition when compared to its new condition. Three subsystems of bridges and culverts receive overall condition ratings. NBI condition ratings are assigned according to the 0 to 9 scale given in Table 1. Element-level data collected for BMSs are assigned on a scale of 1 to 3, 1 to 4, or 1 to 5 based on the particular element. Condition state 1 for an element is the best condition. The percentage of an element in each defined condition state is recorded during Pontis inspections. The Pontis condition inspection data with extensive detail down to each individual element made agencies and experts in the  area. Pontis inspection results provided agencies with much more detailed condition data for the aforementioned NBI items. Using the more detailed element-level data at hand for other bridge management requirements when possible is essential because data collection is a time and resource-consuming process. The NBI Translator was developed at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The Pontis program has this software tool as a built-in module. It can be used for the translation of NBI condition ratings from a defined set of element condition states for specified bridges. Table 3 is adapted from 13. Hearn, Cavallin, and Frangopol 13 describe the table-driven element NBI generation. Percentages of element quantities in condition states are denoted by P. Each row in Table 3 checks the sum of percentages for a minimum required sum. NBI ratings for each item deck, superstructure, substructure, and culverts are calculated by a weighted combination of element ratings. NBI condition ratings are modified based on the smart flag condition reports. Smart flags may reduce the NBI ratings by a maximum of three points. The PC-based version of the NBI Translator algorithm has been available since 1994. Traditional NBI inspections for bridge subsystems are still being done since the translator results are not accepted as satisfactory by a majority of the states. KDOT decided that the translator results were statistically insufficient and inconsistent. Al-Wazeer et al. 1 proposes an alternative for NBI generation to improve the results of NBI Translator. The superiority of the ANN model to the NBI Translator cannot be generalized since the statistical results are valid for only the data used in the study. The study drew attention to the importance of customizing the prediction model for each state. Before using the NBI Translator for Iowa bridges, it was customized according to the element configuration of the Iowa BMS. This customization was done by modifying the driver file, Elements.prn, in the Pontis program folder which defines the elements to be included in the translation 13. There were some elements in the Iowa Pontis setup which were not defined within the original Elements.prn file. In order to include these elements, all seven fields of information for each element were coded into the modified Elements. Prn file to be used in NBI condition rating generation. Figures 1 through 4 summarize the findings of the comparison. The translator was originally set up to estimate deck ratings as equal to or below 7. While 34 of actual deck ratings have values of 8 and 9, the NBI Translator estimates no deck rating within this range. The percentages of generated 5, 6, and 8 ratings are greater than the actual case. For the substructure ratings, the percentages of 4, 5, and 6 ratings are very close for substructures.

Routine bridge inspections are usually completed using only visual inspections. In this context they are considerably dependent on the subjective assessments of the bridge inspectors. Although national and local agencies provide guides and guidelines to assist bridge inspectors in the data collection process. The current NBI Translator algorithm was developed based on element-level condition data and NBI ratings from 11 different states and from approximately 35,000 bridges. Data from different states was banded together and used as the input data to develop this general algorithm. The discrete characteristic of the NBI condition ratings make it impossible to use the ordinary least squares regression to develop an estimator. Developing a customized estimator based on state-specific data may result in a more efficient and sufficient estimator and also motivate agencies to use such a tool. The data has potential to come up with a generalized linear model. The main challenge with the research is to define the most appropriate input structure for the model. After the model is developed it is planned to test the model with the data from other states. The results of the statistical comparison for Iowa bridges showed that the generated ratings by NBI Translator algorithm with its current configuration are not representative of the actual NBI ratings. Using mapping constants specific to only Iowa bridge data instead of using the mapping constants calibrated with the data from 11 different states may be an option. An algorithm that calculates a 0 to 9 rating in an objective and consistent manner might be what is needed for improved bridge management data. Future research will cover the development of a simplified network-level tool utilizing consistent objective data. 2. A Highway Accident Report, Collapse of U.S. 35 Highway Bridge.

Hydraulic Vulnerability Assessment Program developed by the New York State Department of Transportation is applied to evaluate three bridges. Case study demonstrates that this is a feasible method for identifying bridges exposed to hydraulic risks that warrant immediate or future vulnerability mitigations. This approach documents potential component hazard failure scenarios, identifies common component failure modes, and develops a structured methodology. The same case study is reanalyzed with the comprehensive approach to illuminate undocumented roadway and highway risks. For roadway transportation systems these approaches have been formalized into computerized infrastructure management systems including Pontis in the United States and KUBA in Switzerland 1,2. These existing approaches consider risk the probability of failure multiplied by the consequences of failure indirectly. Vulnerability assessment and prioritization tool based on the existing Bridge Safety Assurance Program developed by the New York State Department of Transportation NYSDOT was proposed 3, 4. This vulnerability assessment p. oding because the uncertainty related to such sudden events is far greater than the uncertainty of gradual deterioration processes. The hydraulic vulnerability assessment program starts with an initial screening of the existing bridges to determine which bridges are susceptible to hydraulic-induced failures. Then the vulnerability of the susceptible bridges is assessed with a two-stage assessment process in which a the bridge vulnerability to the given hazard LS and b the potential failure consequences FC are assessed. The LS and FC assessments are then A LS to hydraulic hazards is composed of a hydraulic assessment of the bridges location and a structural assessment. The hydraulic assessment HA rates the bridge hydraulic vulnerability as a function of the following 10 categories: River slopeflow velocity, Channel configuration, Existing evidence of scour, Bridge opening capacity, Debrisice accumulation potential. The HA ratings for the 10 categories are then totaled, resulting in a hydraulic vulnerability rating ranging from a maximum of 25 to a minimum of 1. With the HA completed, the focus then shifts to assessing the vulnerability of the bridge foundation BF. As with the HA, the BF vulnerability assessment is a category ranking system. Each of the 12 categories is subdivided into subcategories, with each subcategory being assigned a numerical rating value as a function of the subcategorys contribution to the overall element vulnerability. The structural assessment of the BF is then the maximum AV and PV rating. CS is then employed to assign the various bridges to one of three vulnerability classes. Signed bridge event likelihood scores LS CS 35 high vulnerability LS 10 CS 25 low vulnerability LS 2 and 40 CS 20 medium vulnerability LS 6. Failure Consequence Assessment The potential FC are assessed by assigning rating values as a function of the following three categories Potential failure type 15, The exposed traffic volume 02, and The bridge contribution to the transportation network 03. Bridges in the capital program are bridges prone to failure under only extreme flooding events. Bridges included in the inspection program are nonfailure-prone bridges given that the current conditions remain constant. Bridges identified as no action and not applicable are bridges with an extremely remote probability of failure. Three bridges designated bridges 1, 2, and 3 located in the Canton of Aargau in north-central Switzerland. These three bridges span the Wigger River and link the city of Zofingen to the adjacent towns Strengelbach and Brittnau. The existing structure was in a severely deteriorated state, thus the Wigger River was placed into bypass conduits. The vulnerability of the three bridges to potential flood-induced damage was evaluated using the hydraulic vulnerability assessment. All three of these structures were determined to have a low vulnerability. All three bridges are designed with horizontal shear keys and drilled piles at all support locations. Hydraulic Vulnerability Assessment manual would recommend that no action should be taken apart from the continuation of biannual on site hydraulic inspections. A bridge is the infrastructure component with the largest potential post-failure interruption duration and reconstruction costs. A single 45-m bridge can take multiple weeks and cost SFr 300,000 US300,000. bridges commonly only comprise less than 2 of a given transportation system. Recent developments in the natural HA domain include the documentation of the maximum possible geographical reach of gravitational natural hazards i.e., avalanche, landslide, rockfall, and torrent hazards. These recent developments provide a number of the inputs required to mulating natural hazard and infrastructure component databases. Birdsall and Hajdin 345. assess the vulnerability of infrastructure components to natural hazards, specifically, the location of the river confluence. Zofingen Case Study Hydraulic Vulnerability Assessments Assessment Topic Bridge 1 Bridge 2 Bridge 3 Streambed material Cobbles Cobbles and Cobbles River slope Medium 1 Medium 1 medium 1 Channel bottom Stable 1 Stable1 Stable 2 Adequate opening and overflow relief were assessed. There has been no comprehensive infrastructure failure assessment approach with which to estimate the implications these documented natural hazards may have on the built infrastructure. In the absence of such a approach, this report provides an overview of some of the key components of the infrastructure. A current Swiss National Science Foundation funded research program entitled Consideration of Vulnerability in the Management of Swiss Transportation Infrastructure is working to develop such an infrastructure failure assessment framework. A comprehensive approach, qualitative assessment approaches like the Bridge Safety Program have been the only tools available for assessing vulnerability. The vulnerability of a transportation infrastructure component includes the probability of inadequate performance and the related consequences due to a defined set of natural hazard events. The consequences of this inadequate performance can take two different forms a direct consequences to the exposed component in the form of structural damage and indirect consequences by restricting the free flow of traffic. A vulnerable transportation infrastructure link is likewise defined as a link containing one or more vulnerable components. i i Vulnerability is thus the probability of component i experiencing failure due to a given hazard event P multiplied by the sum of the direct and indirect natural fiE hazard induced consequences CD, CI respectively. The processes of assessing the vulnerability of an infrastructure component is comprised of the following steps. Evaluate whether the given component is exposed to the potential hazards. Consult or develop if required the infrastructure component failure assessment framework for the respective natural hazard and infrastructure component.  component failure assessment logic is developed by documenting the scenarios through which each hazard avalanche, debris flows, floods, landslides and rockfalls can cause a given component roadway, bridge, or culvert to fail. Calculate the component and associated link annual risk of failure. A flood can cause a bridge pier to fail horizontally in shear or flexure. There are five different failure scenarios for the flood bridge hazard component combination. Twofoldsome of the components with a low number of failure scenarios are not exposed to all hazards. The components with a high number of failure scenarios, bridges and galleries, are exposed to avalanches, landslides, or rockfalls. For a roadway component to be operational, other supportive componentsspecifically, culverts and retaining wallsmust also be functional. The set of failure modes is developed by identifying the common failure modes or each component. For example, the five different hazards can cause a roadway component to partially or completely fail in 10 different failure scenarios. These failure modes can be confirmed and organized in a causality chain. There are five hazard component failure scenarios that can be simplified into two common failure modes. Each failure scenario has different direct consequences, but all induce the same marginal indirect result. This failure assessment process is presented in Figure 2 and determines the controlling failure mode. The first culvert failure mode, a culvert becoming clogged with debris i.e., avalanche, debris flow, landslide, or rockfall debris, is assessed in a similar manner as the first roadway failure mode. A different perspective is required to evaluate the second culverts discharge capacity, for this failure mode is a direct product of the culvert design capacity. Each hazard can induce a bridge component to fail in at least five different scenarios. Bridge pier foundation can be compromised. A bridge superstructure can fail vertically in shear or flexure. The resistance of a culvert to this second failure mode is a direct product of its resistance. A bridge roadway surface can be submerged in liquid or debris. A bridge is by definition an elevated structure. The superstructure, superstructuresubstructure connection, and the substructure all have their own structural capacities multiple additional forms of resistance. This structured assessment process not only identifies which failure modes are mutually exclusive but also what component and hazard data are required to conduct each assessment step. With the failure mode identified, the failure durations, direct and indirect consequences for the given component natural hazard scenario can be modeled or estimated. The area around Zofingen is prone to flooding, and flood hazard maps for 30-, 100-, 300-, and 10,000-year return period events have been developed. Step A of the component failure assessment process, assess potential geographic coincident between the infrastructure components and the natural hazards. All three bridges are geographically coincident with the flood waters for all return periods. Bridge 3 has the superstructure and bearing vertical and horizontal structural resistance to withstand the applied flood forces. All three bridges have pile foundations and are set on pile foundations. The depth of soil removed by the flood below the roadway surface is assumed to be zero. The length of each component experiencing failure was determined from the geographic componenthazard coincident analysis. The direct component consequences and component closure durations were formulated from expert opinions. The component daily detour times were modeled with the Swiss National Private Transportation Model 11. The total annual link risk is then computed from the summation of the marginal risk between each return period threshold with Equation 8. From Table 3 it can be seen that the annual risks of links 1, 2, and 3 are all under SFr. 14,000 per year. Link 2 is the link with the highest risk link of the three links with an annual risk of over S Fr. 13,000, with over 75 contributed by potential traffic distributions.

The Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment Approach is a viable method for transparently evaluating the potential infrastructure failure risks. The broad scope of this vulnerability assessment approach enables it to evaluate potential failure risks of many different types of components and component classes. Existing transportation infrastructure management systems have been developed to manage gradual deterioration. The proposed vulnerability assessment approach, the Bridge Safety Assurance Program developed by NYSDOT, is reviewed and applied to assess the vulnerability of three bridges. This focused case study demonstrates that this qualitative assessment approach is a feasible approach for evaluating and ranking bridge components exposed to flood hazards. A comprehensive vulnerability assessment program is developed by documenting the various hazard component failure scenarios and identifying unique component failure modes. A structured and systematic assessment process employing hazard and component data is then employed to evaluate the potential of each failure mode.

Giamboni, M. SilvaProtect-CH Phase 1. Gefährenprävention, Bundesamt für Umwelt BUFA, 2007. 7. Loat, R. Hazard Mapping in Switzerland. FEDRO All components of bridge management have a potential for multihazard implications. This paper shows a simple and general quantitative method for computingMultihazard effects on different bridge management tools. The costs of bridge ownership include, among others, cost of inspection, repairretrofit. Ettouney, Alampalli, and Agrawal presented a theory of multihazards that can be used in addressing this immediate task. The theory indicates that as hazards affect the bridge, they interact together through different aspects of the bridge. Inspection, guides and manuals, and repairretrofit are discussed. Examples in each case that show how to quantify the multihazard usage in bridge management and end with some recommendations for future efforts are offered. The objective is to minimize Equation 1, subjected to the constraints S S 2 j j. If we assume that the total number of safety constraints are N , then SAFETY j 1,2,, N . We note that Equations 1 and 2 formally represent MO. The double summation in Equation 1 can be generalized into a triple summation as shown below. The variable MT is described as the cost of the ith management tool to accommodate ik the kth hazard. Equation 4 will permit study of multihazard considerations for bridge management. MHT is HAZARD l i MHT . The kth and th components of CT are CT and CT , respectively. The cost of the l ikl i ik il kth hazard with regard to the ith management tool, if no other hazard is present is Cost CT 2 8 ik ik. Conventional bridge inspection is visual and is a major component of bridge management. It can be subdivided into three broad categories scheduled, hazard specific, and specialunscheduled. The special or unscheduled inspections are conducted post-hazards, i.e., after a major earthquake or wind storm. The manager estimates that the cost of inspection of each of these hazards can be estimated as in relative terms 1, 2, and 4 monetary units. The inspection multihazard matrix is a square matrix of order of 3. The manager estimates its components to be 360 Transportation Research Circular E-C128. There are currently numerous bridge rating or vulnerability manuals and guides for different hazards 4, 5. These manuals and procedures form the basic tools of bridge management. We note that there are some interactions among the hazards that are the subjects of those manuals in the manner that they affect the bridge. Multihazards consideration aims to achieve. dundancy in the evaluation process. If such redundancies are reduced or eliminated, then the process can become much more efficient. The benefits of multihazard considerations in the manuals or guides include more efficient and less redundant procedures. There is a value for including multihazard considerations for bridge manuals and guides. Figure 6 shows how multihazards can affect a given bridge structure. We discuss the questions can we employ aMultihazard strategy for bridge repairretrofit efforts? Also, can we utilize a SHM strategy to utilize the potential benefits of multih Hazard considerations The interrelationships between the needs and causes of different hazards are shown in Figure 6. The extra costs of considering multihazards versus additional benefits must be weighed for the most efficient management approach. Discussion of the fourth component is beyond the scope of this paper. The potential SHM role in bridge management considerations of multihazards is shown in Table 1. There are three main components of the budget of any repairretrofit initial costs, discount rate, and service life of both the bridge and the repair retrofit itself. We note that all of these budget components are dependent on multihazard considerations they all interact through the Alampalli and Ettouney 367 Also, the net benefits of pu. re Management Conference.

Monte Carlo Simulation A potential method for estimating the multihazard matrix MHT is the Monte Carlo simulation tool. The proposed retrofit is used as the basis of the analysis. The computed structural responses are used to compute the off-diagonal terms of MHT. Armed with the completed matrix, the manager can now estimate the cost of the retrofit. There are numerous knowledge gaps that are needed in order to fulfill the promise of multihazards usage in bridge management. These include improved automated design, analysis, and decision-making tools for processing the multihazard approach. One of the primary causes of bridge failure is overloaded commercial vehicles. In order to prevent deterioration of a bridge it becomes important not only to design and build bridges according to the regulations but also enforce commercial vehicle maximum weight standards. B-WIM devices have become an important means to better enforcement and better bridge design in many international countries. The objective of this paper is to gather as much information as possible about existing and emerging B- WIM systems in order to determine its potential for implementation in the United States. The main objective of this study was to assess the performances of the system based on the preliminary data. The data was analyzed with regard to overloading on axles single axle or axle group or gross weight overloading. The effect on the road structure was also analyzed. Ments were carried out to gain a picture of the make-up of the heavy traffic in terms of loads and the incidence of overloading. We can establish a foundation in fact for a appropriate actions to achieve better compliance with regulations. In United States a large majority of transported freight to be trucked is required on the nations highways. Illegally overloaded and oversized vehicles damage bridges and pavements and create safety hazards. This hastens the need to inspect heavy vehicle flow on highways and thereby reduce deterioration of our roads and bridges. Of the approximately 600,000 bridges built before 1940, 220,000 40 of the total bridges are considered deficient or of obsolete design. FHWA has estimated over 51.0 billion is needed to keep roads and bridges in their current state of repair. Data collection and interpretation on the truck type, axle weight, gross weight, space of axles and speed provides valuable information to state highway agencies. To weigh heavy vehicles on a static scale at low speed or on portable pads is the common practice. WIM system can provide increased highway efficiency and vehicle classification and axle spacing. The most common technologies of sensor types in WIM system in practice include piezoelectric sensors, capacitive mats, bending plates scale. WIM systems are to obtain accurate axle load and gross weight to support transportation planning and decision making purposes. Bridge WIM can offset the dynamic effects as bridges are long compared to the pavement WIM system. The balance between cost and accuracy should be considered. The geometric features of the site influence the accuracy of the dynamic and static load measured at the site. The major concern of environmental requirements is climatic conditions, traffic conditions and the facilities needed to install and operate the system. The main advantages of WIM systems over their static counterparts include the following. A free traffic flow is ensured and better rates of processing are provided. The sensors are less influenced by dynamic effects. Dynamic weights of heavy vehicles are provided and more sites can be monitored. Bridge WIM is a WIM system using an instrumented bridge as a large sensor. The strains measured in some of the bridge elements are used to determine the gross weights and axle loads of vehicles crossing the bridge. Bridge WIM method was developed by Moses and his team in 1979. Measurements during the entire vehicle passing over the structure provide spare data. This is a major advantage over the pavement WIM systems where measurements of an axle last only a few milliseconds.  portable installations are not visible to truck traffic as it crosses the instrumented bridge. B-WIM technology research has been identified as a 2008 PRIORITY by FHWA, and UAB won the UTCA applied research project to install the system. The denser the traffic, the shorter is the optimal length of the structure. SIWIM System SiWIM does not only provide the same traffic data as the pavement WIM systems, but also some additional, measured structural parameters that can be used for o SIWIM system also use NOR or traditionally FAD for detecting the axle loads. If we calculate the influence line based on the strain records acquired at the site, we can ensure the right way to represent bridge behavior in a B-WIM algorithm. Criteria for Some of the Basic Bridge Characteristics Cost 1999, Zag 2003 Criteria Ideal Acceptable Bridge B007239 Structural Reinforced concrete, Concrete, Reinforcing concrete material prestressed concrete, steel masonry, stone Slab, beam systems girders, culvert, steel orthotropic decks Traffic Free trafficno congestion Free traffic no congestion density More than 2 Span More than 1 or 2 spans The influence line is defined as the IL of bending moment at the point of measurement strain transducer location. The more accurate the influence line, the more accurate of the axle weights can be obtained. Trucks of known weight are used to calibrate all bridge WIM systems. Accuracy is evaluated according to the European specifications for WIM by comparing WIM results to the values obtained on a more accurate static scale. Class A5 is the most accurate one and is followed by classes B7, B10, C15, D20, D25 and E30. The bridge is a nine span simple supported T- beam bridge with span 9 34 ft 306 ft. y in Alabama. Figure 3 shows the elevation, plan and cross section of the bridge. For SiWIM instrumentation eight strain transducers were mounted on the soffit of the beam at the eighth span. Bridge B007239 was calibrated according to limited reproducibility R1 under environmental repeatability I. The calibration test was short measurements in mostly constant environmental conditions. Five-axle semi-trailer trucks were used for calibration as preweighed trucks. WIM system can be used for accurate traffic planning and reconstruction of roads. System can also be used to selecting of potentially overloaded trucks from traffic flow. With WIM measurements we can get information about places, date and time when and where overloaded trucks appear. Heavy vehicles according to GVW.378 Transportation Research Circular E-C128 International Bridge and Structure Management Conference from SiWIM. Method used the reference axle loads according to the Swedish code, which specifies single, double and triple axle loads. Table 4 list the Cumulative ESAL factors and overloading information during the time interval 1047 a.m. to 1516 p.m., October 23 to October 25. When optimizing assessment of existing bridges, which are most likely heavily deteriorated and thus suffer from reduced carrying capacity, many heavily deteriorated bridges can still be saved. The best technique for the reliable traffic load acquisition is the use of a WIM system. WIM results are used either to model the site- specific loading schemes or to develop the appropriate rating assessment loading schemes. Without WIM data highway asset owners and managers are not aware of and cannot properly respond to the problems of overloading. WIM measurement is performed using the formula Mores, 1987 Q aW H mIg 2 0.95 where Q predicted maximum li. All parameters, except a, are random variables and are evaluated from the WIM data. The objective of any load testing is to measure response of the bridge structure in order to optimize bridge assessment use. The convolution method was used to simulate the headway factor H.  known diagnostic load testing and proof load testing. The major disadvantage of both types of load testing is their cost. A novel concept of soft load testing was introduced through the implementation of SiWIM systems. The method can be efficiently applied on a large number of bridges without interrupting the traffic. The main focus of the work done was on improving the reliability of methods for determining traffic loading on bridges. Bridges are unusual in that a high proportion of the total loading is due to the dead and superimposed dead load. The further research will discuss material properties and their on-site measurements. In a bridge management system, structural safety is estimated by the rating factor RF. A bridge must always fulfill the following criteria. The true load distribution factors how load distributes over the main structural elements lead to safety factor. Safety is then expressed as CapacityDeadloading Safety. Bridge WIM is a WIM system using an instrumented bridge as a large sensor. It is used to determine the gross weights and axle loads of vehicles. As bridges are long compared to pavement WIM sensors, the dynamic effects have less effect on accuracy of bridge WIM syst. SiWIM system is a powerful instrument for collection of traffic loading data. The FAD systems are promising and provide a strong reason for preferring B-WIM against pavement sensors. The results of the research will establish the foundation necessary to further advance the implementation of Bridge WIM technology. Real-time information collected at Bridge WIM can be beneficial not only for road users but also for the overall management of efficiency, safety and environmental protection on the road network. The research what we are doing and the further research on B-WIM system will provide good benefits. Zhao, Uddin, Hitchcock, Salama, and Abd-El-Meguid 383 OBrien, E., and A.

It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members. The Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the Academy by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government. The National Research Council was organized by the Academy in 1916. The Transportation Research Board is one of six major divisions of the National Research Council. Its mission is to provide leadership in transportation innovation and progress through research and information exchange. The Council is administered jointly by both the Academies and the Institute of Medicine. A four member committee for Guidelines for Underwater Inspection of Bridges was set up by Railway Board vide letter No. 2003CE-1BR-III2Pt dated 23.1.2007. The members of the committee as nominated by Board include i EDBSRDSO- Convener ii CBE Central Railway, Mumbai iii CBES The committee was directed to critically analyze the studies done by RDSO and IRICEN and provisions in International codesmanuals. The committee had deliberated and critically analyzed the details and guidelines for Underwater Inspection of Bridges. Guidelines on Underwater Inspection of Bridges is being published in supersession of earlier guidelines BS-40 issued by RDSO. These are general guidelines and the process of inspection may need to be modified depending upon the condition of site. Underwater photography and video equipment are considered in the study. The S.N.I. report also considers underwater lighting, drift and debris. The report concludes with the conclusion of the Underwater Photography and Video section. Bridges that cross waterways often have foundation and substructure elements located under water to provide the most economical overall design. The condition of substructure and foundation under water cannot be easily determined. Underwater inspection and management techniques must be undertaken to establish their condition so that unsafe condition can be avoided. Underwater bridge inspections are essential to maintain the safety of the bridges. Specialised equipments and skilled divers are required to carry out a satisfactory under water inspection. The bridge inspector and the diver must be able to act as a team in relaying the proper information. The existing provision on underwater inspection as per para 1107 dis as below. The substructure of the bridges which are normally under water should be inspected by adopting suitable methods which may include engaging of divers and special equipment. It is a good practice to schedule underwater inspection immediately after monsoon. The dive should be timed for the period when the tide is stable for the bridges located in the backwaters. Underwater inspections are of three types a Routine inspection- This is an underwater visual inspection. The basic purpose is to detect obvious damages or problems. This is the maximum interval at which all underwater elements of a bridge, even if it is in sound condition, must be inspected. Any problems identified during the inspection may necessitate going in for Detail Inspection. This inspection should be of Level I. There are three Levels of underwater bridge inspections. Level I is a visual inspection, a feel inspection and a special inspection. Level III is an unscheduled Inspection. This inspection is required to be carried out in the following cases- After unusual floods. After vessel impact unless it is obvious that no damage has occurred. Level I inspection is a visual inspection on entire underwater substructure of the structure to determine obvious major damagesproblems. Level II Detail visual inspection that includes cleaning of areas for closer inspection. Level III Investigation of specific components using Non Destructive Testing. The report of a Level I inspection should comprise of the following Method and extent of investigation. Water depth sounding and scour around piers and abutments. Verification of continuity of the piers in full length. Registration of spalling and corrosion. The marine growth, like algaebarnacles sea grass snails oysters etc. if any, must be cleaned for surface inspection. One or more of the following conditions may dictate the need for a Level II inspection. The cleaning of the substructure components is to be performed in three different water depths. During the inspection, damage or deterioration spalling, corrosion, cracks, etc. or corrosion should be detected and measured. The extent and severity of the damage should be documented. A clear water box and water jet cleaning equipment may be used if necessary. A Level III inspection is a highly detailed inspection of critical components or components where extensive repair or possible replacement is contemplated. The Level III Inspection forms the necessary basis for the detailed assessment of the damage and the preparation of the rehabilitation design. The tests are planned using all available information from the drawings, previous underwater inspections of the bridge, underwater inspections and the knowledge and experience of the persons performing the underwater inspection. On this basis a hypothesis concerning the cause of damage and the condition of the damaged area may be formulated. The scope of Level III inspection can vary substantially by the type and severity of event. Inspection must be sufficient to determine the need for emergency load restriction or closure of bridge to traffic. If measurable damage has occurred, inspections must evaluate section loss, misalignment of members, and loss of foundation support. Significant earthquake bridges also need to be inspected after an earthquake where structural damage is expected. Evidence of deterioration or movement many underwater deficiencies only become apparent above water when the distress extends above the water line or is manifested by lateral movement or settlement. NDT methods which can be used for under water inspection are Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge - Steel.  BS Report No 48 2002 Guidelines for Inspection Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Concrete Bridge. 2.0 TYPES OF DAMAGE Different types of damages observed are as under - 2.1 General structural damage Permanent deformations deflectionsdisplacement Tiltsettlement Abnormal vibration too slender structuresinsufficient supports 2 The underwater Inspection of the bridges involve divers going under water for the purpose of inspection and record videography. In Scuba diving, the diver is provided with compressed air supply through a Scuba tank, which is strapped to the divers back. The minimum equipments required are scuba, wetdry suit thermal protection, life preserver, weight belt to counter buoyancy, knife for emergency, face mask for breathing, swim fins for navigation, depth gauge to estimate depth, wrist watch, etc. Depending on the site conditions, additional equipments may be resorted to. Mixed air is used for the same situations as normal Scuba diving. It has the advantage of extending the diving time to a great deal. The disadvantage is that it needs more preparation. There is no communication arrangement in standard Scuba equipment. Air is supplied to the diver through umbilical hoses connected to the surface air compressor tank. It requires more equipment than the Scuba diving. Oxygen can be mixed with air Nitrox to extend dive time in shallow water. Trimix or Heliox will make it possible to dive deeper than 36 meters. A number of factors influence the proper underwater inspection method. Depth of water alone should not be the sole criteria in determining whether a bridge can be inspected by skin diving without suit. Still photographs and video records facilitate in-depth documentation of underwater inspection. Still photography shall be done using digital camera of minimum 5.0 Mega pixels with 10x optical zoom. Wide-angle lenses are preferably used where visibility is limited and camera is required to be placed close to the object. Suspended particles often dilute the light reaching the object and can reflect light back into the lens. There are three main problems in turbid water, which limit the viewing performance of an underwater camera. These are - Absorption - Refraction - Reflection. Camera should be capable of taking image at zero Lux with LEDs on. Control the lighting and focussing and communicate with the diver. Reflection is probably the most critical factor for the performance of cameras in turbid water. The suspended particles in the path of illuminating light reflect a portion of the illuminating light directly back into the camera. This backscatter, can often be limiting factor in the use of underwater visual imaging system. The problem of reflection can be minimised by carefully placing the flash away from the axis of the camera and at angle to provide reasonable coverage of the subject. In this arrangement, a very high powered, tight beam spot light beam angle less than 100 is used. The effect of backscatter tends to be much reduced as there is little directly reflected light. The underwater torch should be of minimum capacity of 3 Watt for skin diving and minimum 10 Watt for ScubaSurface area supplied diving. The output of the torch for skin. diving should be 80 Lumen Lm with a burn time of 3 hours and for. other types a minimum of 450 Lumen. Lm. Not suitable for close-up inspection as there will not be enough scatter. Divers can work in current below 1.5 knots with relatively little hindrance. As current increases, special precautions are required. In swifter current, shielding devices and special anchor systems may be required. There is no limit placed on the duration of diver up to 18m depths. Whenever depth of diving exceeds 18m, decompression should be carried out. Divers must also have a safety concern about the build-up of debris near a bridge. The requisite qualification for divers and diving supervisors are given in IS10291 1982, which stipulates that the diver should be at least 18 years of age and should not have any sickness at the time of Diving. The working agency should have its own diving safet. 2 First Aid Standard First Aid Kit Box should be available. For major works requiring engaging Six Divers two Diver-Teams or more preferably a qualified doctor should be present on the Boat. All divers, including equipments, should be covered by Insurance. Underwater inspection should include all pierabutment surfaces between the high waterline and the mud line. The entire pier surface may be divided into suitable number of segments along the perimeter, each covering a spacing of 1 to 1.5 m. This facilitates identification of location of defects. The report includes an evaluation of the assessed conditions and recommendations for further action. The report should provide sufficient technical detail to support the assessment and recommendations. The Level I Level II inspection reports should be sent to sectional Sr.DENDEN for scrutiny and for planning of works. The objective of the guideline is to facilitate the writing of comprehensive, standardised, and usable reports. Since underwater inspections are specialised, a report format"

For culverts with 3 to 6 metre spans and retaining walls, the inspection interval can be increased to four years. The timeframe of two years and four years refers to calendar years. It is recognized that the level of effort involved in performing a detailed visual inspection will vary depending on structure type and age. The maximum inspection interval and the level of inspection may however vary for certain structures. Some structures may have to be inspected more frequently as directed by the Engineer. Such action can be justified based upon the type of structure, construction details, existing problems or restrictions. More detailed investigations and non-destructive testing techniques are required to identify defects. Inspection procedures detailed in this manual do not apply to the mechanical or electrical parts of movable bridges.

An emergency situation exists when a structural component contributing to overall stability of the structure has failed, or is in imminent danger of failure. In such cases, a detailed visual inspection should be carried out immediately. Typical problems that may cause an emergency situation to develop are Accident or vehicle collision with a structure Spring run-off or major flooding An earthquake Underwater investigation Fatigue investigation Seismic investigation or Structure evaluation.

Corrosion ........................................... 1-2-18 2.3.2 Permanent Deformations .............................. 1-1-19 2.4.3 Cracking  Asphalt Pavement. .5.2 Splitting, Spalling and Disintegration .............. 1-2-36 2.5.3 Loss of Mortar and Stones This section describes the defects that are normally found in concrete, steel, wood, masonry, aluminum, asphalt pavements and coatings. Each defect is briefly described and the causes producing it are identified. Severity levels, wherever possible, are established. The following defects commonly occurring in concrete are described - Scaling - Disintegration - Erosion - Corrosion of Reinforcement - Delamination - Spalling - Cracking - Alkali-Aggregate Reaction - Surface Defects. Scaling is the local flaking, or loss of the surface portion of concrete or mortar. Disintegration is the physical deterioration or breaking down of the concrete into small fragments or particles. Disintegration may be caused by de-icing chemicals, sulphates, chlorides or by frost action. Erosion is the deterioration of concrete brought about by water-borne sand and gravel particles scrubbing against concrete surfaces. Similar, damage may be caused by flowing ice. Severe erosion of a concrete footing is shown in Figure 2.2.3. Corrosion is the deterioration of reinforcement by electrolysis. In the initial stages, corrosion may appear as a rust-stain on the concrete surface. The surface concrete above the reinforcement cracks, delaminates and spalls off exposing heavily rusted reinforcement. Delamination is defined as a discontinuity of the surface concrete which is substantially separated but not completely detached from concrete below or above it. Delamination begins with the corrosion of reinforcement and subsequent cracking of the concrete. A spall is a fragment, which has been detached from a larger concrete mass. Spalling is a continuation of the delamination process whereby the actions of external loads, pressure exerted by the corrosion of reinforcement or by the formation of ice in the delaminated area results in the breaking off. Spalling of patched areas may occur due to continued deterioration of the old concrete and subsequent breaking off of the new patch. Spalling may also occur in areas of localized high compressive load concentrations, such as at structure supports, or at anchorage zones in post- tensioned concrete. Cracks resulting from externally applied loads initially appear as hairline cracks and are harmless. As the reinforcement is further stressed the initial cracks open up and progressively spread into numerous wider cracks. After this point the concrete cracks and the tensile force is transferred completely to the steel reinforcement. Internal restraint forces are caused by the differential expansion or contraction of the exterior surface of concrete relative to the interior mass of the concrete. Cracks resulting from the actions of external restraint forces develop in a similar manner as those due to externally applied loads. Movement cracks may be of any orientation and width, ranging from fine cracks above the reinforcement due to formwork settlement, to wide cracks due to foundation or support settlement. Differential movements or settlements result in the redistribution of external reactions and internal forces in the structure. In Ontario, there exists several sources of aggregates that react adversely with the alkalis in cement to produce a highly expansive gel. The expansion of the gel and aggregates occurs due to hydroxyl ions in the concrete pore solution, which under moist conditions, leads to cracking and deterioration of the concrete. Once the alkali-aggregate reaction starts, there are no remedial measures to stop or reverse the process of deterioration. However, sealing the surface to reduce the moisture infiltration does slow down the reaction. The appearance of concrete affected by the reaction is shown in Figure 2.8.  Surface defects are not necessarily serious in themselves however, they are indicative of a potential weakness in the concrete. Segregation is caused by concrete falling from a height, with the coarse aggregates settling to the bottom and fines on top. Honeycombing is produced due to the improper or incomplete vibration of the concrete. Efflorescence is a deposit of salts, usually white and powdery. Exudation is a liquid or gel-like discharge through pores or cracks in the surface. Severe POP-OUTS are shallow depressions resulting from the breaking away of small portions of the concrete surface. Severe ABRASION is the deterioration of concrete brought about by vehicles or snow-plough blades scraping against concrete surfaces. SLIPPERY CONCRETE SURFACES may result from the polishing of the concrete deck surface by the action of repetitive vehicular traffic. There are no severity descriptions for slippery concrete surfaces as this is a serious and potentially hazardous situation. Flexure Cracks Shear Cracks Torsion Cracks Axial Cracks Figure 2.2.3 STEEL The use of steel has progressed from cast iron, wrought iron, rivet steel and plain carbon s. Corrosion is the deterioration of steel by chemical or electro-chemical reaction resulting from exposure to air, moisture, de- icing salts, industrial fumes and other chemicals and contaminants. Weathering steel, on the other hand, will form a relatively smooth rust layer, called a patina, which protects the underlying metal. Weathering steel must be exposed to intermittent wetting and drying cycles to form a tightly adherent patina. In less than ideal circumstances, the patina may not form or may be penetrated and delaminated, resulting in progressive corrosion. Corrugated Steel Pipe culverts experience rusting after the protective galvanizing coating has worn off. Permanent deformation of steel members can take the form of bending, buckling, twisting or elongation. Permanent deformations may be caused by overloading, vehicular collision, or inadequate or damaged intermediate lateral supports or bracing. Permanent twisting deformations appear as a rotation of the member about its longitudinal axis. Uckling deformations normally occur in a direction perpendicular to the applied load. Buckling may also produce local permanent deformations of webs and flanges of beams. Local buckling of culvert wall usually near areas of higher curvature primarily due to bending forces. Bolt Tilting is the bearing failure at the location of the bolt holes. Global deformations usually occur on the roof or sometimes on the floor of the culvert.  Steel Culverts - Medium - Bolt Tilting, Crimping or cusping 10 mm height. Any deformation 10 of diameter. - Severe - Crimping 10mm height. The location of the deformation within the member, and the location. of the member in the structure should be recorded. Brittle fracture may result at fatigue prone details after initial fatigue cracking. Details in fatigue stress categories E and F are most susceptible to fatigue crack growth. The primary factors leading to fatigue cracking are the number of applied stress cycles. Cracks caused by fatigue usually occur at points of tensile stress concentrations, at welded attachments or at termination points of welds. Welded details are more prone to cracking than bolted or riveted details. Grinding off the weld reinforcement to be smooth or flush with the joined metal surfaces improves fatigue resistance. Cracks can occur due to improper installation or due to higher bending or compressive forces in the culvert walls. Bolted and riveted connections are also susceptible to cracking or tearing resulting from prying action, and by a build-up of corrosion forces between the parts. Cracks that are parallel with the direction of stress are usually not as serious however, those Members perpendicular are very serious. Loose connections can occur in bolted, riveted or clamped connections. Immediate action is required when cracks are noticed i.e. notify bridge owner. Loose connections may not always be detectable by visual or hands-on inspection. Cracking or excessive corrosion of the connector or gusset plates or the fasteners may be indications of loose connections. Tapping the connection with a hammer is one method of determining if the connection is loose. All connecting member plates shall be inspected with the overall connection rating based on the worst of these components. For Bailey Bridges, the Bailey panel connection pin shall be rated as a connection."

Wood was one of the earliest materials used for structures, and is still in common use today. This is largely due to its availability in a variety of structural sizes and ease of handling. The following defects commonly occurring in wood are described - Checks, Splits and Shakes. Weathering is the gradual deterioration of wood due to exposure to the actions of sun, rain, wind, frost and atmospheric pollutants. Treated wood weathers more slowly to a gray-brown colour and may exhibit a rough wash-board appearance. Light weathering is shown in Figure 2.4.1a. Rot or decay is the biological decomposition of wood caused by micro-organisms called fungi. Rot develops in progressive stages, usually through cracks, knots, holes and at the ends of members. The most common method of reducing rot or decay in wood is by pressure treatment with preservatives. Wood appears as a grey fibrous mass. It develops at or above ground contact and may attack both the surface and interior portions of wood. Brown rotted wood has a reddish-brown appearance, and in advanced stages has a checked or crumbly surface. Soft rotted Wood has a soft, spongy surface. The wood sounds hollow when tapped and offers little resistance to penetration by a sharp object. Considerable damage with 10 to 20 section loss Very Severe - The wood can be crumbled and disintegrated"

        "response": "Termites, carpenter ants and wood-boring beetles are the most common insects that attack wood in Ontario. The severity of the insect damage can be judged by the number of holes and tunnels on the surface of the wood. Abrasion is the deterioration of wood brought about by vehicles or snowplough blades scraping against wood surfaces. Wear is usually the result of dynamic andor frictional forces generated by vehicular traffic. It can also result from the friction of ice or water-borne particles against partly or completely submerged members. Cracking, splintering, crushing and shattering are forms of physical damage which result from vehicular collision or from overloading of a member. Particularly susceptible are members already weakened by rot or insect attack. Medium - Surface wear more noticeable with 5 to 10 section loss. Severe - Loss of section between 10 to 20. Shattering is a combined form of crushing and splintering resulting from impact. Fire damage is evidenced by charring and is usually confined to the wood surface. Chemical damage may result from the use of non-preservative chemicals on the wood. The effect of chemicals on the wood is a softening of the surface accompanied by loss of strength. The effect on metal connector plates and fasteners is less critical except in certain circumstances for example, on fasteners with low corrosion resistance. Loose connections may not always be detectable by visual or hands-on inspection. Cracking or excessive corrosion of plates or fasteners, as well as permanent deformation of the connection or members framing into it, may be indications of loose connections. The severity of loose connections depends largely on the number of loose or missing fasteners. The severity of gusset plates depends on the amount of severe or very severe corrosion or cracks. Any unintended gaps that are observed should be measured and recorded. Masonry is made of stones or bricks bonded together by mortar. Although not a common construction material today, masonry was used in Ontario, usually in retaining walls, abutments, piers or arches, primarily in the 19th century. Cracks develop in masonry as a result of non-uniform settlement of the structure, thermal restraint, frost action and overloads. Cracks develop either at the interface between the stone and mortar, following a zig-zag pattern, when the bond between them is weak.  splitting, spalling and disintegration of masonry is caused by the actions of frost, weathering and abrasion or, by theactions of acids, sulphates or chlorides, which cause deterioration in certain types of stones, such as limestone. Figure 2.5.3 shows evidence of loss of mortar in a masonry arch. It should be noted that some structures have been built without the use of mortar. Aluminum is often used in railings, splash guards, drainage systems, signs and sign supports. Aluminum has a strong resistance to corrosion deterioration after the initial formation of aluminum oxide. In less than ideal circumstances this protective layer may fail to form, or be penetrated and broken down to expose the underlying metal. The process of corrosion will then continue with progressive loss of section. Galvanic corrosion may affect the formation of the protective aluminum oxide film or cause the film to flake off. An inert spacer, either nylon or neoprene, should be placed between the two metals to prevent galvanic corrosion. A crack is a linear fracture in the aluminum which may extend partially or completely through the material. Cracks normally develop as a result of fatigue followed by brittle fracture and excessive corrosion. As cracks may be concealed by corrosion by-products, dirt or debris, the suspect surfaces should be cleaned. Loose connections can occur in bolted, riveted or clamped connections. Cracking or excessive corrosion of the connector, gusset plates fasteners, as well as permanent deformation of the connection or members framing into it, may be indications of loose connections. The severity of the connection deficiency shall be based on the condition of the worst component within the connection. In the case of truss members, the connection shall be taken as the entire joint or node location. The location of the loose or missing fasteners, as well as areas of corrosion on gusset plates, should be described. The severity of gusset plates depends on the amount of severe or very severe corrosion or cracks relative to the total plan area. The severity description involves the determination of this ratio. Asphalt pavement is often used as a wearing surface on concrete, steel and wood decks. Wearing Course Is a dense, highly stable, durable, skid-resistant surface course hot mix asphalt. Binder Course is the lower layers of an asphalt pavement. Rigid Pavement Including composite pavements consist of a concrete slab with bituminous overlays. Asphalt defects on concrete decks or slabs are sometimes an indication of deterioration of the concrete surface. Defects in asphalt pavements can be related to the lack of durability of the asphalt resulting from the composition. A crack is a linear fracture extending partially or completely through the pavement. Cracking in pavements may be caused by any one or a combination of the following factors: vehicular wheel loading poor quality material poor compaction placement or quality control. Alligator cracks form a network of multi-sided polygons or blocks resembling the skin of an alligator. Transverse cracks are approximately at right angles to the pavement centreline and may extend partially or completely across the pavement. Edge breaking of the pavement often results from these cracks. The various types of pavement cracks are illustrated in Figures 2.7.1a to 2. 7.1e. Severity Light - 1 mm to 5 mm wide single or multiple cracks - alligator pattern established with corners of polygon blocks fracturing. progressive edge cracking less than 600 mm from pavement edge, either single or two parallel cracks. Medium - 6 Widespread loss of bond and delamination may occur between the asphalt pavement and deck surface, between the waterproofing and the deck surface or between individual lifts of pavement. Loss of bond is not directly visible on the pavement surface however, they may often be detected by hammer sounding or chain drag. Rippling is the result of poor bond of the pavement to the surface below. Potholes are bowl-shaped holes in the pavement caused by the penetration of water through the pavement. Pavements already deteriorated with such defects as alligator cracking and ravelling are prone to the occurrence of potholes. Local delaminations become visible as protrusions or bumps. These are localized upward displacements of the pavement surface. Ravelling is the progressive deterioration and loss of the pavement material from the surface downward. Ravelling can occur anywhere over the surface, but is most common along curb or sidewalk faces. Severe ravelling may occur together with signs of cracking or potholes. Flushing is the migration of asphalt upwards to the pavement surface in pavements with too much asphalt in the mix. It commonly occurs in the wheel tracks, especially during hot weather, by the action of vehicle traffic pressing and squeezing the excess asphalt to the surface. Slippery asphalt surfaces may result from flushing or from the polishing of the coarse surface aggregates. Wheel track rutting is the formation of longitudinal depressions in the pavement at the locations of the wheel tracks of vehicles. There are several types of material defects that commonly occ. ing from 10 mm to 20 mm deep. Coating defects are not necessarily serious in themselves however, they are indicative of a potential weakness in the coating. Coating Related Defects are defects related to the basic chemistry or composition of the coating. Adhesion Related defects are defects which are usually a result of incorrect coating selection, contaminated substrate or improper surface preparation. Application Related Defences are defects that occur when the coating is applied incorrectly. Cracking is an extension of the checking process and usually occurs in a linear pattern and penetrates completely through the coating. Cracking may result from the effects of weathering or continued polymerisation of the coating materials over time. An oxidizing or catalyzed coating applied over a very smooth surface may crack. As the surface hardens and shrinks, very large irregular checks, usually several centimetres across, are formed on the surface in a characteristic alligator pattern. If not over-coated with compatible material then, the mechanism will continue until it completely penetrates to the substrate. Chalking is usually a surface defect and the coating is intact below the chalky surface. Chalking can progress and the thickness of sound coating reduced to the point where the substrate is exposed. Undercutting is also promoted by high moisture vapour permeability of the coating and penetration by oxygen and salts. Intercoat delamination is where one coat separates from another. It is usually related to poor coating application over contaminated surfaces. Peeling is also a result of poor adhesion of the coating either from the substrate or from a previously applied coating. Coating failure is promoted by poor surface preparation, substrate profile and surface contamination. e, such as oil base and alkyd coatings. These oxidize over time to a point where they become porous to moisture, oxygen and chloride ions. Overspay occurs when paint particles fall on the surface outside the normal spray pattern. Dry spray will absorb solvent from the subsequent coats resulting in poor adhesion. Pinholing can be caused by holding the spray gun too close to the surface so that air bubbles are entrained into the coating. pinholing usually occurs in fast drying coatings. SAGS are heavy thicknesses of paint which have slipped and formed curtains on the surface. PINPOINT RUSTING usually occurs when insufficient thickness of coating is applied over a blast cleaned substrate. The profile peaks lack proper protection and continue to rust.

The defects produced in the stream by the presence of structure components in or near the stream are detailed in this section. An assessment of the stream and channel stability is important for determining the need for protective measures. There are three principal types of streams namely, meandering, straight and braided. A meandering stream is characterized by alternative S-bends which migrate laterally downstream. Meandering streams may be unstable. A straight stream is one where the length of the stream, measured down the centreline of stream, is less than 1.5. A braided stream is identified by numerous General scour is caused by the constriction to the natural flow created by the structure. Local scour occurs as a result of an obstruction to the flow, such as, a pier, an abutment or the toe of the embankment. Ice jamming can cause severe local scour by constricting the opening at the structure. The impact of ice flows can cause bending of exposed steel piles and the breaking of timber piles. PIPING is the subsurface removal of fines by the movement of water through the ground or embankments. Flooding occurs if the opening under the structure was not designed to accommodate the volume of water passing through it. Channel blockage may occur as a result of accumulations of debris due to natural causes, beavers dams, or due to aggradation of the stream bed or banks. Channel constriction produces scour channel profile with increase in flow around the bridge during flood velocity and degradation upstream. Scour around piers is influenced by location of pier to flow. Rip-rap around pier may cause local scour at upstream. Embankments are sloped fills or cuts in the vicinity of the structure. The purpose of the embankments is to provide for a stable change of grade between the roadway and the surrounding ground surface. Embankments are to be considered as primary components if they support the foundation, otherwise, they are tobe considered as secondary components. Faces of embankments may be protected from the effects of erosion or scour by slope protection systems. The purpose of the slope protections is to prevent the erosion or scour of embankments and stream banks in the vicinity of the roadway. Performance defects are also related to the ability of the embankment to provide support to the foundations without appreciable movements. A secondary purpose is to control the growth of grass and vegetation on steep slopes where mechanical equipment cannot be used safely. Material defects in slope protections are related to their ability to protect the embankments and stream banks from erosion or scour. Rip-Rap Stones, Rubble. Random, hand-laid or grouted.

Shallow foundations, footings, are used where rock or soil with adequate bearing capacity is at or near the ground surface. Shallow foundations are normally made of mass concrete, reinforced concrete, wood or masonry. Caissons are normally made of large diameter tube piles or box sections made of concrete, steel sheet piles or H piles. Piles or caissons may terminate with or without a footing, which may be located below ground or water level. Abutments are commonly made of mass concrete, reinforced concrete, or wood. Occasionally, masonry, steel piles, precast concrete, wire baskets, and reinforced earth have been used. Piers consist of a number of components, each serving a specific purpose. Retaining walls are commonly made of mass concrete, reinforced concrete, wood. Occasionally, masonry, steel piles, precast concrete, wire baskets, bag mortar and reinforced earth have been used.

Bearings are not needed in some structures, for example, culverts and rigid frames. Bearings are made of steel, rubber, neoprene, polymers, aluminum or a combination of these. Bearings are subdivided into two main categories, fixed or expansion bearings, based on their capability for movement. Fixed bearings do not allow for translation but may allow rotation. Expansion bearings allow fortranslation and may also allow rotation, as illustrated in Figure 6.1a to 6.2g. Steel plate bearings may be used with or without translational and rotational capabilities depending on the number of parts provided. Elastomeric bearings provide translation and rotation as a function of their stiffness. Pot and disc bearings provide rotation. Rotation is provided by compression of a confined elastomer or polymer disc. Cylindrical bearings rotate about the axis of the cylinder, while spherical bearings can rotate about any axis. A TFE sheet is often bonded to the lower surface. Rotation for single rollers is provided by the curved surface of the roller. For multiple rollers, rotation isprovided by a pin connection or curved surface in plate above the roller nest."

Examples of thick slabs used are illustrated in Figure 8.1.2. Half-through trusses are not connected across the top chords allowing for unrestricted overhead clearance. Sway braces or rakers are connected between the top chord and floor beams, or needle beams, to provide lateral restraint. The bottom chords are also connected by lateral bracings below the deck. Lateral bracings and floor systems for the bailey bridges are similar to the half-through trusses described above. Trusses are built up of individual components interconnected in triangular arrangements in such a manner that the components resist applied loads. Some of the truss components may also be subject to flexural, shear or torsional loads. Typical bailey bridge configurations and components are shown in Figures 8.1.3b and c. For a complete coverage of bailey bridges see reference 1. Open spandrel arches are used where the soil is capable of resisting the horizontal thrust of the arch. In steel tied arches there may also be a system of lateral bracing under the deck. In this type of arch, the deck and floor system is supported on columns carried down to the arch ribs. Filled spandrel arches are commonly used for short spans, and is usually fixed ended. The sides of this arch are closed by retaining walls and wingwalls. Barrel arches have sides that are open and therefore there are no retaining walls. steel arches consist of individual rolled sections or are built-up by bolting, riveting or welding several sections together. Concrete arches are usually monolithically cast, with the result that the interaction and stress distribution among the components is extremely complex. When the arches have fixed ends they are very sensitive to differential settlement or rotation of the foundation, which may produce overstressing and cracking. A tunnel is a bridge constructed through existing ground. In most cases it provides access to pedestrian, rail or vehicular traffic. Soil- steel structures are comprised of corrugated steel pipe or plates, and soil. Culverts, tunnels and soil-steel structures are divided into two main types according to cross-section namely, open invert and closed invert. Vertical loads from the overlying soil and traffic are transmitted by arching action to the underlying soil. Where these structures are used to carry water their basic components can be divided into inlet, barrel and outlet. Diaphragms span between the primary load carrying components such as beams, girders, deck trusses or are located inside box sections. Typical examples of culverts, tunnels and soil-steel structures are illustrated in Figure 8.1.5c.  load bearing diaphragms directly support superstructure reactions or are designed for jacking purposes. Non-load bearing diafragms provide lateral support or restraint to other superstructure components.

Wood decks are commonly used on secondary roads and rural highways. Orthotropic steel decks consist of a flat steel top plate surface welded to a supporting system of steel girders. The top surface of the deck is either left exposed and acts as the wearing surface or is protected by an additional wearing surface. A waterproofing membrane placed between the deck and asphalt wearing surface also provides additional protection. The only differentiation between a curb and a sidewalk shall be width.

Precast masonry is sometimes used as well. Typical examples of curb and sidewalk construction are illustrated in Figures 9.1.1 and 9.3. Drainage from the approaches is normally drained into drainage ditches or caught at catch basins before it reaches the structure. Surface drainage on structures is channelled along the curbs and drained through deck drains or allowed to drain off the deck. Deck drains are anchored to the deck by metal bars, or rely on their shape.  Deck drains vary in size and shape, and vary from single pipes to prefabricated pipe and catch basin units. Deck drains can also occur individually or be interconnected to an extensive collection system terminating at storm sewers.

Hazard Markers shall be used with the narrow structure signs. Hazard Marker signs are used to mark structure limits when they are within 2 m of the edge of the roadway in conjunction with the Narrow Structure sign. Left or right hazard markers are erected with the stripes sloping at an angle of 45 degrees. Advance clearance sign located not less than 100 m nor more than 250 m in advance of the subway. Advance clearance sign is available in two sizes. Single maximum weight signs are erected to limit the gross weight on bridges under the authority of an Ontario Regulation. There may also be other signs at structures, such as, speed restriction, slippery when wet, bailey bridge ahead, marine warning lights and signs. 12.1 DEFECTS OF SIGNS The following are some of the typical defects in signs. Utilities most commonly hung from, attached to, or installed in the structure are - Water mains, Gas mains - Bell ducts - Hydro lines. Electrical attachments to bridges generally are - Light Poles - Underpass Lighting - Cathodic. Noise barriers on bridges typically have posts anchored to the barrier wall with panels between the posts. Other attachments can include - Banner mounting hardware on bridges, - Fixed Automated Spray Technology FASTfor de-icing. Design live loads from 1917 to present date are shown in Table 14.2. Design live loads prior to 1917 are not documented. In general, truck loads of 15 tons or less were used depending on the age of the bridge and class of highway. Evaluation loads, Table 14.3, were introduced in Ontario in 1979. Prior to that evaluation of bridges for load carrying capacity was normally based on the design loads. loads were normally used first for the major highways and later introduced on the other road systems.

Material Condition States are used to categorize the condition of an element based on the severity of material defects. Four Material Condition States have been defined for bridge elements. The condition of bridge elements is defined to be in any one or more of these Condition States. An exceptionally poor localized zone in a critical element may render the entire element ineffective. For such cases, the particular element can be considered to be 100 Poor and immediate action must be taken. This includes notifying the owner to initiate temporary repairs and a strength evaluation. The importance of recording quantities of defects cannot be over-emphasized. Using rough percentages without some sort of verification will usually lead to a grossly inaccurate estimation of rehabilitation needs. For many elements, the condition states will be recorded as an area measurement, m2. For some elements, such as the expansion joint armouring, the data is recorded by linear metre. For example, a bridge with 10 bearings may have 5 bearings in excellent condition, 3 bearings in good condition, 1 bearing in fair condition and 1 Bearing in poor condition. The Condition S table has been created for each material type e.g. steel, concrete. Tate that an element is in is defined by"

In concrete, any type of spalling or delamination would be considered poor since these defects usually indicate more serious underlying problems. These types of defects may trigger a preventative maintenance type of remedial action e.g. sealing, coating, etc. For most elements, a general progression through the various condition states occurs over time. The difference between The Excellent and Good condition states is not always obvious from a distance. Minor defects can be detected upon close visual inspection of elements more than 5 years old depending on the exposure environment. The presence of material defects usually triggers further, more detailed investigations. Additional investigations are usually triggered when a pre-determined percentage is exceeded in the poor Condition State. In addition, material defects often lead to performance deficiencies, which would trigger other follow-up actions, such as a strength evaluation. ies and corresponding follow-up"

        "response": "Non-Destructive Testing Methods for Detection of Defects in Steel Components. A comprehensive non-destructive testing program of steel bridge components should be carried out whenever the members are cleaned to bare metal. Non-destructive testing allows materials and structures to be examined for defects without changing or destroying their usefulness. A wide variety of techniques have been devised among which the most commonly used, in addition to visual inspection, are Liquid penetrant or dye penetrant LP Magnetic particle MP Ultrasonic Testing UT Eddy Current testing ET Radiographic RT. The standards permit minor surface discontinuities and non-significant internal defects which are smaller 4-1-1than the minimum allowable size. These defects, which remain in the finished product and are smaller than the maximum allowable defect size, usually have little effect on the strength of the member. Non-destructive techniques can be applied in the field to identify and evaluate defects. Corrosion combined with cyclic stresses causes stress corrosion cracking. This results in the reduction of a components strength and ability to carry design loads. A liquid penetrant, a brilliantly coloured penetrating oil, is applied to the cleaned surface and allowed to seep into the surface defects for thirty minutes or more. Excess penetrant is then removed and a developer agent is sprayed onto the surface. The developer dries to a white chalky coating and remains unchanged in the absence of any defects. The sequence for liquid penetrant application and typical images are shown in figure 1.1. Advantages Highly portable Relatively inexpensive Can be applied to a wide variety of non-porous surfaces Rapid method of inspection Results can be recorded photographically. Magnetic Particle Magnetic Particle Testing is used to detect surface and near surface defects. Fine magnetic particles low retentivity iron powder distributed over the surface are attracted by the leakage field and held magnetically to form an outline of the defect. Both AC and DC electric current is suitable for magnetizing steel components. Surface defects are most readily detected with AC magnetization. DC magnetization provides greater penetration for detection of subsurface defects. Advantages Surfaces must be reasonably smooth to avoid non-relevant indications. Non-conductive coatings must be removed where the prods contact the metal. Prod method of magnetization can cause arc burns and possible cracks. High frequency sound waves are introduced into a material for the detection of surface and internal defects. The reflected waves returning to the source can be displayed as pulses or signals on the screen of a cathode ray tube. The travel time of the returning pulses is a measure of the distance to the interface of the defect. Ultrasonic systems can detect discontinuities that are larger than one half of the wave length of the signal. A system operating at 5MHz will detect defects larger than about 0.5mm.  angle-beam method and contact pulse reflection can detect internal defects and fatigue cracks. Few restrictions on size of work piece Ideal for testing wrought materials and welds. High noise levels are produced by coarse grain structures such as cast iron. Eddy current testing is a method based on the principles of electromagnetic induction. The component or part thereof to be tested is placed within or adjacent to a coil which is excited by an alternating current. As the induced current fluctuates, an eddy current is produced which flows in a closed loop inside the test material. Radiographic Testing is based on the ability of ionizing radiation in the form of X-rays or Gamma Rays to penetrate solid materials to produce an image on film or a fluorescent screen. Skilled and experienced technicians required to interpret the indirect test results. Cracks or defects absorb less of the available radiation and create a darker image than the sound material. Cracks with depths of about 1.0mm or more should be detected under normal conditions. This method is not well suited for testing i The use of ultrasonic testing would be a suitable test method in place of radiographic testing. Gamma ray equipment is more portable while the less portable x- ray equipment can produce better contrast and definition of defects. CGSB 48-GP-4M Certification of Non-Destructive Testing Personnel. Radiation sources must be heavily shielded. Testing is expensive, particularly in the field. Liquid penetrants are ideally suited to rigid government controls. The technique will confirm a discontinuity on the surface of a component and show its size but with no indication of the depth. Magnetic particle testing is a simple method for quickly evaluating extensive welds and surface areas. It too is most suited to detecting surface discontinuities. Radiography is a major non-destructive testing method which is routinely applied to the examination of welds and assemblies during fabrication. Eddy current testing will provide accurate detection of surface and near surface defects but requires the surface to be quite smooth.

        "response": " Methods for detecting deterioration in wood described herein are separated into two groups namely, those which identify exterior or surface deterioration, and those which are used to assess deterioration in the body of the wood. There is no single tool or method that can accurately determine the extent and severity of deterioration. Of the methods discussed, none can satisfactorily identify all defects. Probing with a knife, awl or screw driver can locate decay near the surface of the wood. Decay is indicated by excessive softness and lack of resistance to penetration. Sound wood has a fibrous structure and pries out as long splinters, while decayed wood breaks abruptly and crumbles into small pieces. A pilodyn figure 2.2.3 is a spring-loaded pin device that drives a hardened steel pin into the wood. The depth of pin penetration is used as a measure of the degree of decay. The existence and extent of the problem should be confirmed and defined with core samples. Sounding is a commonly used method and involves striking the surface of the component with a hammer. A dull or hollow sound may indicate the presence of internal voids due to decay. Moisture meter measures the electrical resistance of the wood between two metal pins. The resistance measured is then correlated to the moisture content in the wood. Moisture contents in excess of about 30 indicate conditions suitable for decay. A small hole is drilled into the wood figure 2.3.3b and a probe is inserted into the hole. The probe measures zones or regions of decreased resistance. If the readings drop 50 to 75 to that of sound wood, the region is drilled and cored. A hand drill with a 10mm to 20mm diameter bit is used to drill a hole into the wood. Zones or pockets of decay and deterioration are noted by ease of drilling and by examination of wood shavings. Drilling and coring are generally used to confirm suspect areas of decay identified by other methods sounding, moisture meter etc. The presence of fungi is indicative of wood in an early stage of decay and in need of treatment. Dull tools will break, crush and splinter the wood making interpretation of samples and results difficult. The piece of pressure treated wood is used as a plug to repair damage done by boring. A shell-depth indicator is a metal bar or rod which is notched or hooked at one end and inscribed with ruled markings. The inspector can thus determine the depth and extent of decay and remaining solid portions as read from the ruler markings. Sonic wave velocity, acoustic emission and stress wave analysis have been used for examining wood. These methods involve the use of devices which emit and pick up sound waves as they travel over the surface and through the depth of the wood. High frequency sound waves are induced into the wood by means of a transducer and picked up by another mounted on the opposite side. Advantages Can determine the approximate location and area of deterioration. Can be used to evaluate the saturated zone at the water line. Disadvantages Still developmental to some extent. 4-2-162.4 Post-Inspection Procedure and Treatment Several of the inspection methods and tools described involve the removal or destruction of a portion of the wood. These locations, such as at drill and probe holes, will become entry holes for insects and decay. All the surfaces at these locations must be thoroughly treated with an approved preservative.

These components cannot be thoroughly evaluated from the water surface and must be occasionally inspected below to determine their condition and state of deterioration.

Material which is continuously submerged remains saturated and there is little oxygen available to promote deterioration. The pH of most surface water is close to neutral and temperatures below the surface vary over a narrow range. The underwater environment is hostile. It is cold, particularly when one is submerged for an extended period of time. A wide variety of methods have been developed for underwater inspection. Several of these techniques are described ranging from low water wading, skin diving, and diving with SCUBA or a surface supported air supply. The use of divers using SCUBA or a surface supply is regulated by the Department of Labour. All structural components are visually inspected, where visibility permits, or examined tactually.

All members of the diving team must be fully trained in the use of all diving equipment and devices and in the performance of underwater work.  Ultrasonic testing of concrete under ideal conditions is difficult to successfully carry out. This is due to the unique cracking patterns that develop in the material and block the sound waves. The problems encountered are compounded underwater and although it can be used, the results are not always reliable. Magnetic particle testing techniques are also used underwater for cracks or discontinuities in the surface of components. The process is the same as used on the surface except the magnetic particles are in a water suspension of fluorescent dye. Care and experience are required to assess the results obtained.

Such an inspection of the entire structure can be carried out relatively quickly in the presence of minimum deficiencies. Concrete structures will experience little in the way of deterioration below the critical zone at the water line. Zebra mussel infestations are creating unusual problems for structures where they are established. As they grow and multiply an anaerobic environment is created at the surface of the substrate which is conducive to the development of sulphur compounds.

The level of detail required will dictate the procedures and equipment to be used. A Level 1 Inspection will provide a v A tactile examination of the exposed underwater surfaces of a structure in sufficient detail to detect major damage or deterioration.

Based on soil types and the water velocity through the bridge opening the following scour potential ratings should be applied. A rating of 6 indicates scour will never be a significant problem whereas a rating of 3 or less indicates the need for further investigations and possible protective measures. Each structure must be rated based on the potential for collapse. Stream bed must be carefully evaluated by probing or through various geotechnical techniques. A visual examination of the stream bed by a diver will indicate if active erosion is occurring and will identify exposed piles or the underside of spread footings. Stream bed, both upstream and downstream of the structure and within the water passages should be sounded where any potential exists for scour. Sounding is best obtained by using a recording type echo sounder with particular attention being given immediately adjacent to the abutments and piers. Sonar equipment is reasonably portable and can generally be mounted in or on any type of boat. A wider angle will result in more extraneous signals due to reflections off the vertical surface and will be more difficult to interpret. Weed growth on the bottom will affect the accuracy of observations. Ground penetrating radar is a relatively new procedure for geotechnical investigations.

The guidelines will provide organizational structure examples for a UAS program, airframe selection considerations, personnel training, bridge inspection method- ologies, data processing, and data storage. UAS can improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of a Routine Inspection with element-level data collection. UAS did not improve the efficiency of Routine Inspections that would typi- cally be conducted from the ground. Data was reviewed and cataloged in the field during the UAS inspection process. UAS imagery and videos were shared with three qualified bridge inspectors for an in-office desktop review. The reviewers noted that there were observed defects that warranted a closer inspection. The use of uncrewed aircraft systems UAS for bridge inspections has increased dramatically in recent years as advances in airframes, sensors, and onboard computing have made UAS more prevalent in the industry. The capabilities of controlled flight and onboard camera systems make UAS an ideal instrument to perform bridge inspections. for Bridge Element Inspection 2019 will provide needed guidance for the standardization of UAS in the bridge inspection industry. The main objective was to develop guidelines for implementing UAS into routine bridge inspections with element-level data collection. The intent was to test the efficacy of UAS as a means of access to achieve results similar to past inspections. The inspector is not required to be within arms length of bridge elements during the code-specified Routine Inspection."

        "response": "Uncrewed Aerial Systems Applications for Bridge Inspections Element-Level Bridge Data Collection C H A P T E R 2 Research Approach A literature review was conducted to establish the current state of the art of UAS related to the inspection of civil infrastructure, including bridges. The use of uncrewed aircraft has expanded in recent years as state and federal agencies explore UAS and implement the technology into their operations. The review also included examples of operator training requirements from various bridge owners, as well as examples of UAS used for bridge inspections. Uncrewed aircraft are also commonly referred to as drones. UAS have been used in several applications because they can enable higher quality and faster data collection. State DOTs and federal agencies have used UAS for construction and traffic monitor- ing, land surveying and mapping. State agencies have been hesitant to implement UAS into their bridge inspection programs. Their main concerns are evolving federal regulations, practicality, cost, comparison with traditional methods, data storage, and whether UAS imagery will be allo. Most popular uncrewed aircraft are rotary aircraft with four, six, or eight independently driven rotors. Multi-rotor aircraft are capable of vertical takeoffs and landings and can hover in place. Sensors used for civil infrastructure applications are commonly RGB, thermal, and infrared cameras. The most commonly used off-the-shelf models for bridge inspec- tions have been DJI Phantom, Mavic, Matrice, and Inspire SenseFly. Flight times range from 10 to 30 minutes, but low battery temperatures have been shown to dramatically decrease flight times. In August 2020, the Defense Innovation Unit of the Department of Defense DOD first pub- The Blue UAS list was spurred by data security concerns regarding foreign-made drones being operated around national security assets. State or federal laws or procurement policies may also limit which UAS agencies may use. The Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International is creating a Green cleared U AS list. Aircraft on the Green list will expedite an aircrafts addition to the Blue List, if requested. Losing a GPS signal may eliminate or reduce the airframes ability to hold a certain position and altitude. Object detection and avoidance are useful not only for navigating without GPS signal, but also for maintaining a constant standoff distance from the structure. An appropriate standoff distance also protects the structure and aircraft from inadvertent collisions caused by environmental conditions or remote pilot error. In controlled environments and in practice the standoff can be as little as 1 ft. Cameras can be integrated into the airframe or stand- alone models mounted to a gimbal controlled by either the remote pilot or a sensor operator. Integrated cameras are lighter and smaller than stand-alone cameras but come at a cost of image resolution. Most integrated and stand-alone cameras offer manual in-flight controls to adjust the exposure and account for low-light conditions. There are no minimum requirements for camera resolution, just as there are no vision require- ments for bridge inspectors. SUAS, under 55 lbs in the national airspace are given in 14 CFR Part 107. An exemption can be made to 49 USC 44807 for UAS weighing more than 55 lbs. Anyone operating the UAS must have a remote pilot certificate with an sUAS rating. UAS operations from a moving aircraft or vehicle are generally prohibited. UAS operations are limited to visual line of sight VLOS only. Operations over people are further classified into four categories, with categories 13 based on the size of the aircraft or maximum impact energy. Operations in Category 4 require a 14 CFR Part 21 airworthiness certificate but are allowed out- side a closed-access area. UAS operations at night are also allowed, but the aircraft must have anti-collision lighting visible at 3 statute miles. Remote identification requirements have been updated to take effect in March 2024. Waivers can be obtained for most UAS regulations, but at least the same level of safety must be provided. The FAA promulgates the minimum requirements to legally operate an sUAS. U.S. federal agencies, and cities have established additional policies for using UAS in their operations. These policies generally include flight crew training, planning, and operations. Table 1. UAS training requirements for various local, state, and federal entities. Most agencies require a minimum number of training flights or hours before UAS can be operated on. The U.S. Forest Service 32-hour agency training course 3 takeoffslandings within 90 days 2020 summarizes training requirements for agencies. Most agencies require a minimum number of flights or hours over a period of 13 months before a remote pilot may operate UAS on a project. Ongoing research is looking to establish standardized tests for evaluating claims from UAS manu- facturers and remote pilot competency for bridge inspections. The UAS test will likely be a structure selected by a DOT for evaluating their remote pilots and UAS. Typical defects will be provided in the obstacle course which the user must identify and quantify. It is unclear if this will be done in real time or in post-processing. All bridge types can be inspected with uncrewed aircraft, although how well the aircraft can access certain bridge elements varies. In many cases, it was established that the exterior of the superstructure fascia girders, top of bridge decks, truss members could be easily inspected with UAS. UAS have also been flown in manual mode around the exterior of individual elements, using GPS and proximity sensors. Inspecting the underside of bridge decks or the interior of girders and trusses has proven to be more challenging. Most issues stem from the loss of GPS signals, low clearance underneath the bridge or between members, inadequate viewing angle, and magnetic interference from steel structures. Interior of truss structures are areas where published UAS inspections are deficient. Clearance between members can prevent larger airframes from accessing certain areas, requiring a smaller aircraft or preventing UAS from being used altogether. Concrete spalls, exposed rebar, efflorescencestaining, and cracking are all readily apparent in still images and recorded videos. The imagery must be normal to the surface to accurately estimate the size of the defect. Inspection-specific UAS can even carry both RGB and thermal infrared cameras. Clear identification of fatigue cracks is also a persistent issue in UAS bridge inspections. Vibration, low illumination, camera angle, accessibility, and obstructions dirt, corrosion, previous mark- ings all combine to make fatigue crack detection with UAS difficult. Known fatigue cracks have been observed with standoff distances from 5 to 25 ft, depending on the system. Similar-looking defects have also been misidentified as fatigue cracks. Distortion of steel elements can be observed but may go unnoticed if a UAS cannot view an element from the appropriate angle. The largest benefit of using UAS to supplement routine bridge inspections is access to areas that would have previously required a ladder, UBIT, or aerial lift. These elements include steel bridge decks, interiors of pin and hanger connections, cables and anchorages, and towers above the height of the roadway. Smaller, low-clearance, and low-risk bridges that can be accessed without specialized equipment may not benefit from UAS inspections. UAS-assisted inspections for such structures may increase inspection costs, but higher-quality imagery could still be acquired. 22 survey responses were received. Of the responses received, 95 21 of 22 respondents had received some bridge inspection train- ing. More than half 55, or 12 had more than 10 years of experience. 18 4 of 22 of respondents thought the inspector should be within 10 ft. of an element to conduct a Routine Inspection. 82 18 of 22 thought the Inspector should be close enough to visually assess the condition state. 40 8 of 20 of the respondents were somewhat or extremely comfortable. Some common uses for UAS in bridge inspections were to take photos and videos, supplement Routine Inspections, replace or support inspections with UBITs, monitor and document deficiencies, assess the need for in-depth inspections, and provide an enhanced visual inspection of non-critical elements. Around the world, UAS are used for bridge inspection for many of the same reasons that U.S.- based researchers and DOTs have identified. Countries using UAS for other infrastructure inspections include Australia, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Only the United Kingdom and New Zealand include an allowance for UAS as an alternative access method in their respective bridge inspection manuals. Both prohibit UAS from certain applications. UAS cannot be used if the inspector is required to be less than 3 meters from the structure. Union Pacific has used UAS extensively for structural inspections throughout their network. UAS use is also widespread among international railroads. Within these organizations, use cases for UAS included bridge, culvert, and track inspections. Imagery and video data collected during a UAS-assisted inspection can be used in multiple forms, with varying degrees of post-processing. Complex deliverables such as point clouds, 3-D models, and orthomosaics can be generated from UAS imagery but require more precise data collection tech- niques. UAS imagery can be easily incorporated into an inspection report. Little research has been done to establish whether element-level inspection data collected using UAS is consistent. There is a need for multiple inspectors to work independently to review the same UAS imagery. Inspectors using only UAS imagery were less accurate than those conducting a hands-on inspec- tion. Prior experience with UAS inspections increased accuracy. Post-processing tools can allow lengths and areas to be directly calculated from the imagery. Some areas of bridges or bridge elements were challenging to inspect with UAS. These areas and elements included the interior of girders top of the bottom flange and interior cross frames. These knowledge gaps were used to inform the selection of bridges to be inspected. The literature review identified aspects of UAS inspections that warranted additional research. Aspects of particular interest included cost and time comparisons, optics and proximity comparisons, and a brief study of AI to assist inspectors. 42 of the 100 bridge elements given in the 2014 element-level coding chart were inspected using the two UAS form factors. Site access, proximity, and the research teams familiarity with the structures were considered. The two parallel structures of Bridge 1 carry I-75 over a creek, as shown in Figure 1. The identi- cal three-span structures are 525 ft long and were selected because of their steel open multi-girder. NBIS elements inspected at selected sites are summarized in Table 2.3.

The site was safely accessed by mobilizing from behind the roadway barrier and walking under the bridge. The weather on the day of the inspection was sunny, 60F, with mild winds. PSC prestressed concrete RC reinforced concrete. superstructure is one of the most common systems in the national bridge inventory. The main span towers are post-tensioned at the top and along the mid-height cap. This structure exhibits cracks in the high-density poly- ethylene HDPE stay pipes, slackening steel wind ties, and shear cracking through the pre- stressed concrete girders. Bridges 4, 5, and 6 carry a state road over a major river. This structure was selected because the three-span, 1,918-ft-long cantilevered through truss includes rolled and welded truss members. Oach spans and the exterior of the main span were accessed from the ground adjacent to the structure. The weather on the day of the inspection was partly cloudy to overcast and 70F, with mild winds. Bridges 9, 10, and 11 carry a state road over a major river. Weather on the day of the inspection was sunny and 50F, with mild winds. Defi- ciencies on the 1,057-ft-long main span elements included severed wires in the cables, cracked eye bars, and spalling. The weather on the day of the inspection was sunny to partly cloudy or overcast and about 60F, with mild winds. This structure was selected because the hanger sections of the steel through truss tied arch are riveted built-up sections rather than traditional cables. Bridges 13 and 14 are two separate spans of a structure that carries interstate highways through an urban area. This 2,073-ft-long multi-span bridge was selected because it is a steel open multi- girder structure with pin and hanger systems. The weather on the day of the inspection was sunny and 100F. Bridges 17 and 18 are two 95- to 120-ft-long timber structures that carry rural roads over a rail- road. The dark color and stratifications of the timber tested the UAS sensors ability to adapt to environmental conditions. The two structures also have common timber deficiencies such as splits, checks, and cracking. 2.10 Bridges 19 and 20 are two separate structures that carry a state road and a U.S. highway, respec- tively, over a creek. These structures were chosen for their known scour deficiencies. Inspecting these structures demonstrated the ability of the UAS to inspect substructure elements and adjacent channels. These structures were easily accessible from the ground between the two structures. The weather on the day of the inspection was sunny and about 70F, with mild winds. The main lift structure is a steel truss of riveted built-up members. The bridge was accessible from below and from an adjacent lot. This bridge was in a controlled airspace, and FAA authorization was required. Two models of multi-rotor aircraft were used in this research. The FF1 was a smaller airframe could be held in one hand with advanced obstacle avoidance, a non-interchangeable camera, and single- operator controls. Because of its small size and the three levels of obstaclity, the FF2 was used for bridge inspections. The FF1 airframe is easier to navigate between bridge elements but more difficult to see at farther distances unless the strobe lights were activated. The airframe was also more susceptible to turbulence and wind gusts. e avoidance standard at 34 in., close at 11 in., and minimal at 4 in. 12.3MP CMOS 43-in.CMOS Multiple sensors could be used. 20.8 MP stills and Camera Spec at 60 fps. records 4Kvideo.

However, a different version of this FF1, with the same body style, was listed. Its capabilities are different than those of the non-NDAA-compliant version. In-office preparations were taken to identify and mitigate risks at each site. Operations included a pre-flight checklist, an operations review with on-site personnel, sensor calibration, inspections of the structure and particular elements, and post-flight data review. Remote pilots qualifications included logged inspection flight hours, logged flight hours with the specific UAS form factors, and the comfort level and familiarity of flying a UAS. Before conducting the UAS inspections, it was necessary to prepare the required permits, appli- cations, notifications, equipment, and traffic control. UAS crew members logged flight hours. If inspection reports were available, the on-site team leader reviewed the reports to determine elements to be inspected. This helped each inspection minimize the impacts to traffic and use time efficiently. UAS operations at each site consisted of an initial safety briefing, pre-flight inspections, and a checklist review. A binary yesno assessment for defect detection was also performed to determine whether the UAS form factors could cap- ture enough detail for the inspector. The cracks used were either 0.004 in. or 0.012 in. wide, representing the transition from CS1 to CS2 for cracking in prestressed or reinforced concrete elements. A crack width gauge card was used if a known defect was not available. The UAS was then Figure 19. flown at increasing standoff distances while the camera settings were adjusted. UAS deficiencies spalling, exposed rebar, corrosion, section loss would also be observable if the UAS were flown at or below the maximum standoff distance. This initial calibration also determined the neces- sary camera"

Bridge Element UAS Inspection Procedure Non-UAS inspection Procedure Deck Drainage Inspected during the above-and Inspected as part of the walk-through below-deck UAS will most likely be used for visual inspections that take place during a Routine Inspection. In-depth and Fracture-Critical Inspections may also benefit from UAS, but the current hands-on and arms length requirements for performing these inspections mean UAS will not be used. Two automated mapping flights were conducted at the scour-critical bridges to collect imagery of the structures, channels, and surrounding ter- rain. The intent was to use this imagery to create orthomosaics and 3-D models covering a large area. Post-flight review was undertaken because the resolution of the UAS controllers screen was lower than the recorded imagery. An in-depth inspection could be performed immediately if any critical deficiencies were discovered. The focus of the data processing and review was first to determine which elements were visible in the recorded images.

Minor aspects of the element be adjusted to of the UAS. The remote viewed in any recorded inspection produce an pilot may experience videosstill images. Position of the UAS was in a risky viewed. place for example,over water, near tree branches,but the remotepilot could still maneuver. Element accessibility considered the visibility of the elements and whether there were any obstructions from elements or the limitations of the UAS. Sensor adaptability considered how the camera and lens settings were adjusted to account for environmental conditions. The ranking for remote pilot comfort was more subjective and was affected by the GPS connection. Select videos from three sites Bridge 3, Bridges 13 and 14, and Bridges 15 and 16 were sent to three inspectors to perform a desktop review. The intent of this review was to evaluate the use of UAS-collected video and imagery in an inspection for which the inspector was not present. The intent of this review was to evaluate the incor- poration of current commercially available AI detection programs into a bridge inspection using UAS-collected imagery. The imagery shared with the two firms consisted solely of the prestressed concrete girders with known cracking at Bridge 3. The findings of the AI inspection are presented in the following chapter. Table 11. Desktop reviewers experience and qualifications. Figure 23. Representative image of inspection data sent to two AI firms. The two UAS form factors both had certain limitations that would affect how they would be used in a routine bridge inspection. The major differences were the size and stability of the airframe and the characteristics of the sensor. Both airframes and UAS for bridge inspections in general could be conside in general. The FF1 airframe could be launched and landed by hand, which was beneficial at bridge sites with steep embankments. The advanced obstacle avoidance made constant adjustments to keep the air- frame stable around exterior and interior bridge elements. There was enough space to fly the UAS at a farther distance. The UAS was more stable when flying between prestressed I-girders and steel and prestressed concrete box girders because of the larger planar surfaces and the visual sensors it uses for stabilization. However, when the remote pilot was inspecting interior elements, these adjustments were more discomforting due to the enclosed space and the perceived instability of the airframe.

Prestressed concrete 5 ft 10 The FF1 UAS was not flown through cross frames because the cross-frame members were closely spaced. A more realistic flight pattern for inspecting girder bays during a Routine Inspection would involve flying longitudinally along the bridge, slightly below the bottom flange of the girders. The FF1 airframe was capable of inspecting the truss, deck soffit, floor beams, and stringer. The UAS also captured imagery of the inte- rior of gusset plate connections, but not to the same level of detail as an arms length inspection. The FF1 airframe is a single- operator UAS. The remote pilot must also be the sensor operator, which requires frequently switching focus from flying the UAS to managing the sensor and collecting data. The settings for the camera exposure were not linked to a tactile function on the controller, but rather accessed through a menu on the controllers touch screen. While inspecting cables from the outboard side of the bridge as on Bridge 2, Bridge 7, and Bridge 9, the remote pilot found that the zoom capabilities of the FF1 airframe were inadequate. This meant a lane closure may have been necessary to inspect the inboard face of the cables, although this was not done as part of this project. External lighting attachments were not used because The FF1 airframe captured sufficient imagery to identify most steel deficiencies. The UAS also identified cracking down to 0.004 in., spalls, delaminations, exposed rebar, corrosion, and efflorescence on concrete elements. On timber elements, common defects such as cracking, checks, splits, and section loss were visible but difficult to identify because of the dark color Other deficiencies visible in the recorded imagery were corrosion and pitting of cables, cracked HDPE pipes, and slackening wind ties. At most bridge sites, the FF2 airframe was launched and landed from the ground, the shoulder of the roadway, or the median. The larger size of the FF2 airframe meant the UAS was more stable less susceptible to vortex shedding and wind gusts but needed to be flown farther from the bridge elements. For example, the wind speed on the day of the inspection at Bridge 13 and Bridge 14 was around 16 mph. When flown in the open space between the two parallel structures, the FF1 was very unstable. To inspect the interior girders and deck soffit, the FF2 UAS was flown either from the exterior of the structure or from underneath, depending on the structure and site characteris- tics. In this manner, with the zoom lens, the UAS collected imagery of the deck sofit, one face of the girder web, and the bot. The UAS was equipped with obstacle avoidance, though it was not as sensitive as that of the FF1 UAS. The remote pilot focused on maintaining control of the airframe while the sensor operator adjusted the exposure and zoom settings. The UAS did not fly between the girders or above the bottom flange. The FF2 UAS was flown at farther distances with the zoom lens. The airframe was less capable than the FF1 UAS while inspecting intricate details, such as the cable anchorages on the fascia girder of Bridge 2. The mechanical zoom lens was capable of detecting deficiencies on the inboard side of cables on the opposite side of the bridge. The FF2 airframe with a higher-resolution camera and prime or zoom lens was able to capture adequate imagery of corrosion, section loss, distortion, and cracking in steel elements. In concrete and masonry elements, the UAS captured imagery of cracking, spalls, delaminations, exposed rebar, corrosion, efflorescence, mortar break- down, and The automatic features simplified the flying and data collection compared with the FF1 airframe. The two orthomosaics are comparable and could be used to document the channel conditions and scour effects. A Routine Inspection would be more efficient than a UAS-based inspection at structures. A UAS-assisted inspection could improve the efficiency and safety of Rou- tine Inspections typically conducted from a UBIT or an aerial lift. Using a UAS in these situations would improve the quality of the inspection by providing enhanced access and better viewing angles. It would take 3040 minutes to conduct an inspection of the interior and exterior girders in a span with 56 girder lines. Addi- tional bearings or pin and hanger connections would require an extra 510 minutes. A Routine Inspection of the two steel multi-girder structures may take 12 hours for a team of two inspectors if conducted from the ground. inspecting the interior of gusset plates would increase the required inspection time. These times do not include data management or battery changes. From the ground or a UBIT, a Routine Inspection of the steel through truss may take 68 hours for a team of two inspectors and 3060 minutes per span for the prestressed concrete and steel multi-girder approach spans. While inspecting the exterior truss elements, the UAS flew a circuit across the lower chord, up a vertical, across the upper chord, and down the opposite verti- cal in A Routine Inspection of the main and approach span floor systems with a UBIT and a team of two inspectors may take 68 hours total. A complete Routine and Fracture-Critical Inspection in 2016 took 89 days. A combined hands-on and UAS-assisted inspection took 45 days. A Routine Inspection of a typical steel multi-girder span may take 1015 minutes if conducted from the ground or 3060 minutes using a UBIT. A Routine inspection of the approach span floor system took 30 minutes per span when performed with a UAS. For reference, a complete Routine and Fracture-Critical Inspection of the suspension cables, stiffening truss, floor beams, and towers took 4 days Routine Inspection of a typical prestressed concrete or steel multi-box girder approach span may take 3060 minutes when conducted from an aerial lift or from the ground. Using a UAS, a Routine Inspection may take 15 minutes per span to document and monitor major cracking changes. The automated UAS mapping flights took 30 minutes to document the channel scour conditions. An inspection of the interior truss elements, with the UAS flying vertically between truss lines and rotating in each bay, may take 10 minutes per span. The truss and cable systems require a hands-on inspec- tion conducted from a lift or by rope access. A Routine Inspection may take 1530 minutes per tower for a team of two inspectors. A UAS-assisted inspection of the exterior truss elements may take 1015 minutes. The desktop review test was conducted to confirm the adequacy of the UAS data and the neces- sity of data review processes in the field. One reviewer noted having to guesstimate distances, as distances or member sizes were not shared with the reviewers. Inspectors could perform an inspection solely using UAS-collected imagery but were limited by their inability to see certain elements or the entirety of elements, measure defects, or immediately follow up with a more in-depth inspection before leaving the site. The data was from the prestressed concrete I-girder approach spans at Bridge 3. Both firms processed the data using their respective algorithms and presented the results in an online interface. The algorithm identified concrete cracking, spalling, and efflorescence. At the time of the research, the AI models incorporated into the program could only identify these common concrete defects. When the AI evaluated additional imagery of the reinforced concrete piers and web walls at one of the scour-critical bridges, which were inspected in more detail with automated mapping. Company 2 performed an AI analysis using only the 2-D images from Bridge 3 approach spans but acknowledged that their algorithm was trained to identify cracks only in asphalt pavements. Company 2 noted that their models can be trained for specific applications and materials.  AI-based inspection technology is still relatively young, and only recently has there been focused effort to apply the technology to bridge inspections with element-level data collection. Most research has focused on detect- ing cracks and other deficiencies in concrete and asphalt materials in which defects are readily detectable. UAS can be incorporated into rou- tine bridge inspections with element-level data collection. Commercially available services also provide non-AI benefits, including georeferenced images, 3-D models, point clouds, measurement tools. The FF1 UAS was compact, portable, and had advanced obstacle avoidance capabilities. The small size meant the airframe was more susceptible to wind gusts and vortex shedding as around cables. The lower-resolution camera was adequate when flown close to the bridge elements. The FF2 UAS had dual operator controls, which meant the workflow could be effi- ciently split between a remote pilot and a sensor operator. The higher-resolution interchangeable prime and zoom lenses were also capable of collecting higher-quality video and imagery. The usefulness of a UAS depends on the structure type and current inspection methods. A Routine Inspection of a common steel or concrete multi-girder structure is typically conducted by telescopic-aided binoculars visual observation from the ground below and by walking the bridge deck. UAS may provide enhanced access, better viewing angles, and more thorough imagery. Using a UAS in this manner may reduce or eliminate the need to mobilize heavy equipment, set up traffic control, or work in traffic. UAS would also provide time savings if used to inspect non- fracture-critical elements. A small subset of data was sent to three inspectors who were not present on site. This work was done by a team member who was present when the video was collected. One reviewer noted a bent cross frame and a poor-quality weld that warranted closer inspection.  AI applications hold promise for bridge inspections, but bridge owners need to treat the technology as another tool to assist inspectors. Most AI models and research currently focus on crack and spall detection in concrete elements, with only limited research on crack detec- tion in steel materials.

As the use of element level inspection techniques has proliferated, the need for updates and enhancements to the standard element specification has been identified. This manual is not intended to supersede proper bridge and element inspection training or the exercise of engineering judgment. The changes made to this document are shown in BOLD RED fonts. The STRIKETHROUGH TEXT indicates any deletions. provides a comprehensive set of bridge elements that is designed to be flexible in nature to satisfy the needs of all agencies. The complete set of elements capture the components necessary for an agency to manage all aspects of the bridge inventory utilizing the full capability of a BMS. The National Bridge Elements represent the primary structural components of bridges. The standard condition states are comprised of good, fair, poor, and severe general descriptions. Units of measure are LENGTH in feet, AREA in square feet, and EACH for enumerated elements. Bridge Management Elements include components of bridges such as joints, wearing surfaces, and protective coating systems. These elements are not intended to be utilized for the purposes of national policy making. NJDOT has developed additional BMEs as necessary. The elements presented within provide the flexibility for an agency to define custom elements in accordance with the defined element framework. The identification numbers 800 and above are used in this manual for any ADEs. The NBE elements are intended to form an element basis for bridge condition assessment in the National Bridge Inventory NBI. An agency is permitted to create NBE sub-elements providing that the sub-Elements can be aggregated back together for NBI submission. The Bridge Management Elements BMEs represent many components of the bridges that require preservation but are not primary structural members. These elements include joints, wearing surfaces, protective coatings, and deck protection systems. The number range of 800 and above has been reserved. Agency may wish to individually define the wearing surfaces typically used in their bridge inventory. In this example, these detailed wearing surface elements would be sub-elements of the general BME for wearing surfaces. The BME would not need to be rolled up aggregated for national reporting. Protective systems may need to be set-up to influence the deterioration rates of certain elements. All of these protective coatings will influence the rate of deterioration of the base element that they are designed to protect. Bridge Management Systems BMS will slow or eliminate deterioration as long as the protective element is in good condition. 4.3 Independent Agency Defined Elements Agencies may identify a business need to develop a completely independent custom element that is not a subset or derivative of an NBE or BME. Such custom elements provide the most flexibility as these elements are not intended to be reported at a national level. Independent agency developed elements could include approach guardrails, slope paving, seismic retrofit components, or tunnels just to name a few. Custom element definitions provide a ready-made framework for capturing items such as tunnels, walls, median barriers, and h. nly limited by the number of required condition states. Bridge inspection based on this manual consists of defining the elements pieces of the bridge and total quantities that exist at each bridge. The condition assessment is complete when the appropriate portion of the total quantity is stratified over the defined condition states. Element defects are typically to be used when the elements condition reaches state 2 or lower. They essentially act to break down the overall element condition into one or more specific observed problems. The specific listing of all defects is optional however the element condition must be inclusive of all defined defects. This manual attempts to cover the vast majority of all bridge elements found on highway bridges in the United States. An inspector may find materials or elements that are not defined during the course of their inspection. The granularity of the defect details is typically not specified with defect descriptive language. Elements with a portion or all of the quantity in state 4 may often have load capacity implications warranting a structural review. Agencies may establish additional guidance to aid the inspector in determining the field circumstances where structural review is warranted."

Placing a new noise wall on an existing bridge adds a significant amount of stress on a structure caused by the additional weight and rotational loading. This may result in the need to add additional girders, beams, and diaphragms strengthen the existing bridge deck. The ability to design the noise wall as an integral part of the overall structure addresses most if not all of the issues. Additional costs are still incurred compared to the same bridge without a noise barrier. The proximity of the noise wall to the traveled portion of the bridge usually makes the wall considerably more susceptible to damage compared to most ground-mounted noise walls. Such damage may be caused by vehicle impact, airborne debris such as stones, vehicle parts, snow removal operations, or material from salt spreaders. Bridge-mounted noise walls have raised concerns related to issues such as vehicular sight distance, barrier shading which increases potential for highway icing, and adverse effects on highway lighting. These concerns, except for bridge inspection, are common to both ground-mounted and structure-mounted systems. Noise wall panels or other components are then secured to the beam or posts to create the in- place barrier. Obtaining a smooth or desi. of techniques have been successfully employed to attach noise walls to bridges. Red top of barrier profile with such a system may require each panel to be custom made if the top of parapet profile is not smooth and consistent. Any bottom of barrier jaggedness or gapping can be concealed by flashing. Inserted into parapet This method should only be considered for new bridges. Mechanical anchoring system consists of a wedge shaped nut which is inserted into a drilled or cast hole in the concrete parapet wall. Chemical anchoring systems consist of a two-part epoxy mixture adhesive inserted into the hole. The bolt through system uses long bolts which are inserted into holes either cast or drilled completely through the parapet walls. Cast-in-place bolts - Although a less commonly used method, this anchoring system is considered to be the most effective and least destructive of all methods. Bridge slab may be extended beyond the outside edge of the parapet to provide additional dead load support. Additional barrier anchorage may be provided via angle iron mounted to top of parapet. Post-less systems use either concealed posts or no posts with the panels, typically mounted in the following manners. Masonry Block Noise Barriers are laid up in a manner similar to ground-mounted masonry block barriers. Anchoring is via reinforcing bars extending out of the top of the parapet wall. This type of structure-mounted noise barrier wall is more suitable where short height barriers can provide the desired noise attenuation. A parallel supporting beam or similar structure may be built immediately adjacent to the existing structure. This mounting system is particularly suitable for older or weakened bridges. Fatigue failure of a support structure basically occurs because the stress ranges resulting from the wind or truck-induced gusts exceed the fatigue thresholds at critical details. Most sign support structures are fabricated from structural steel tubes, angles, and plate. The primary loads applied to bridge mounted sign structures are due to natural winds as well as truck gusts. Natural wind gusts exert a fluctuating force that is primarily horizontal, and the resulting motion of the mast arm is also primarily horizontal. The passage of trucks beneath support structures induces both horizontal and vertical gust loads on the structure. Pile supported Retractable Rubber Gravity Hydraulicpneumatic Floating systems.

Examples include Steel Multi-Girder Bridge, Prestressed Concrete Adjacent Box Beam Bridge, and Reinforced Concrete Box Culvert. Concrete Girder Bridge,for Bridge Element Inspection, First Edition, 2013. The examples include the use of National Bridge Elements NBEs and Bridge Management Elements BMEs. The subject of this example is a single-span multi-girder bridge crossing a lake. Reinforced concrete parapets with steel ornamental railings run on both sides of the bridge with curbs and sidewalks. Since the railing material is steel, even though the steel railing does not serve as a redirective element, the metal bridge railing concrete bridge railin. All girdersbeams extend approximately 1 ft past the bearings at each end as indicated on the bridge plans. The steel open girderbeams are protected with paint. For overall element assessment, any defect in the concrete railing portion if any needs to be included in Metal Bridge Railing. Reinforced concrete abutments have integral wingwalls. Elastomeric bearings are on the painted steel girdersbeams. Fixed bearings are at one abutment and sliding plate bearings at the other. Bridge plans indicated epoxy coated reinforcement throughout the entire substructure. A crack measuring 0.25 in wide and 15 ft long was noted in the approach slab. Since this is the only defect noted, the remainder of the area meets the criterium. The affected area Defect 1130 is coded in ft2 1 ft x 15 ft 15 ft2. Paint on both fascia girdersbeams exhibits chalking with loss of pigment throughout the entire exterior web face. The exterior top side of the bottom flange exhibits peeling of the entire finish coat with the primer coat left intact. The South fascia elastomeric bearing exhibits minor undermining. One girder exhibits a small spall approximately 1 in deep that has exposed the girder bottom flange. There is an area of 15 ft exhibiting heavy rust staining, which is coded for Efflorescence Rust Staining Defect 1120 in Condition State 3. All concrete encased girders exhibit moderate scaling. Both abutments exhibit heavy efflorescence build-up with some rust staining underneath all bearings. The underwater inspection report noted an area of minor scour for approximately 12 ft on the Northwest wingwall.

Figure B4.5Structural Evaluation Bridge Management Created 05022014, Rev. 1 01312015B4.3 Element Quantity and Condition State Summary The element quantities, defects and state of the bridge can be summed up in the table below. The subject of this example is a four-span prestressed concrete girder bridge crossing a divided highway. The sketches in Figure B5.1 show the bridge elements with relevant dimensions and note the locations of the defects described in the Element Condition States section below. There is a deck joint at every substructure unit, extending out-to-out of the bridge deck. There is no skew. The defects for Reinforced Concrete portion if any will be included in Metal Bridge Railing. Since the prestressed concrete girders extend past the bearings and are embedded in the end and pier diaphragms, the length of the. bridge minus the backwall thickness 1 ft. The reinforced concrete abutment distributes vertical load to the piles not visible for inspection. Elastomeric bearings transfer load from the girders to the substructure. All remaining element quantities are in good condition and assigned to Condition State One.

In most cases, quantities of elements are estimated based on the number of elements multiplied by the length or width of the bridge. For example, if there are 10 floor beams on a structure and the bridge is 40 feet wide, you can estimate the total quantity as 10 x 40 400. The quantity for box girder depends on the number of boxes which make up the girder. Integral Deck Girders include both an element for girder as well as one for deck. Timber Abutments typically will get 3 different elements, a timber cap, timber column, and timber abutment. Pile Bent Pier will have two elements, a cap and columns. Any diagonal bracing will not be considered in rating the condition of the columns. Concrete Channels are precast channels with normal reinforcement not prestressed.

Indian Roads Congress iiIRCSP40-2019 GUIDELINES ON REPAIR, STRENGTHENING REHABILITATION of CONCRETE BRIDGES.  IRC first brought out IRCSP40 Guidelines for Techniques for Strengthening and Rehabilitation of Bridges in the year 1990. Since then lot of advancement have taken place in testing methodology, testing equipment, repair and strengthening techniques and materials. Initial draft was prepared by the Sub-group of B-8 Committee under Chairmanship of Shri P.Y. Manjure. Condition Assessment Criteria has been introduced in this revision. All the results of visual inspection and detailed investigations are to be categorized into five condition states namely Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor and Critical. Bridges, Specifications and Standard Committee approved this document in its meetings held at IRC headquarters on 24th October, 2018. Executive Committee approved the document on 27th October,. 2018 for placing it before the IRC Council. Thereafter guidelines were approved by the IRC council in its 216th meeting held during 79th Annual Session at Nagpur on 22nd November, 2018 for 1IRCSP The deterioration of bridges is a world-wide phenomenon. The consequences faced are premature bridge deterioration, loss of traffic safety or reduction of structural strength. These could be avoided if focused attention is given to conservation of existing bridges through regular monitoring and timely repairs. 2IRCSP40-2019 defines the process and approach for assessment of distresses, diagnosis of causes, proposing remedial measures and the corresponding methods and techniques for the engineering operations. Many terms resemble one- another but are not identical. Degradation usually associated with wear and tear with age, also used to denote reduction in quality or strength. Demolition The process of dismantling and removal of existing structure. Disintegration Severe deterioration resulting in breakup of components.  maintenance is usually done periodically. It comprises any activity and work including inspection necessary to enable a structure to continue to fulfill the intended function. May partly or wholly restore a specific component back to the original condition. Repair work is intended to prevent further damages to the members and restore functional performance. Remodeling Includes changes in function and performance of the structure due to change in usage or occupancy. In steel bridges, it could be corrosion, breaking or rupturing etc. These activities would be similar to maintenance activities but on a larger scale. In short, repair activities shall consist of remedial action which would broadly include concrete restoration. Retrofitting is improvement intended to restore a specific structural function or enhancement of bridge status to a higher performance level. Strengthening Increasing the strength of the structure by various means such as plate bonding, jacketing, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic CFRP bonding. Bridges are vital link on the highways and road network and are susceptible to deterioration. Assessment and remedial measures are elaborated in this chapter. The objective is to Establish desired levels of maintenance service.  traffic volumes and gross weight of vehicles have been observed to grow continuously. The tendency is to carry as much load as possible on a single vehicle in order to reduce the transportation cost. Authorities many a times, increases the legal axle load limits which needs to be considered. Environmental factors are accountable for the deterioration of bridges. Extreme climatic conditions such as, abnormal variations in wind speed, water flow temperature and vicinity of foul gases, harmful chemicals etc. aggravate the deterioration mechanisms. More complex the structure of bridges, the more difficult it is to strengthen or rehabilitate them. The understanding of type of the bridge structure and its structural configuration is paramount in deciding the type of repair option to be implemented. 2.5 Geographical conditions Many a times these conditions will influence the nature of rehabilitation that needs to be carried out. Treatment to be given to the bridges located in hills and landslide prone areas would differ from the measures adopted for bridges in coastal areas. Some bridges are strategically located such as those at sensitive areas near countrys borders. Safety and serviceability of both the users and the bridge shall be the 6IRCSP40-2019 prime objective. Bridge condition, deterioration rate, future developmental planning considerations, and remaining life of bridge shall influence policy decision. Fund availability and estimated costs of maintenance repairs including for diversion, if any. The general policy must take into account the number of parameters already described in Para 2.2 above. All the activities of bridge maintenance and repairs shall be institutionalized. The bridges may be divided into non-structural elements with relatively short-life spans.  division between short-life and long-life bridge elements is necessary because of the stronger economic motivation to rehabilitate and strengthen long life elements than short life elements. A consideration of alternate materials and techniques available, their suitability and economy are very crucial while making a decision. Traffic considerations and a division between bridges on type of roads i The best strategies can only be determined in the light of assessment of the present condition of the bridge. The root causes of the deterioration should be evaluated and eliminated. Repair and strengthening operations should be mechanically and chemically compatible with the properties of the original or surrounding material. A routine or principal inspection provides a detailed description of some of the damages where an assessment of the structure may become necessary. Testing techniques and equipment should be capable to determine the extent and type of deterioration or damage. To the extent possible, non-destructive tests should be used. The purpose of evaluation of a distressed structure is not only to determine the effect of damage on the structures life expectancy and carrying capacity, but also, and perhaps more importantly, to the possible extent, its cause. Data resulting from the investigation of a damaged structure including monitoring of its distress form the basis for the decision as to what corrective action must be undertaken. The initial concern should be to find out whether or not there is a risk of failure to the damaged structure. If this risk is present, the first course of action must be to immediately provide an adequate auxiliary support mechanism and to reduce the loads to remove the risk. The urgency of repairs, strengthening or replacement must be evaluated in a technical sense along with realistic cost estimates so that proper priorities can be established in budget planning. The question of urgency must also consider an estimation of remaining life expectancy. The most important step in the design of repairs for rehabilitation andor strengthening work is a careful assessment of the existing structure. Guidelines for this evaluation have been issued separately IRCSP37. ary to evaluate the lord carrying capacity of the bridge. The complexity and magnitude of the repair work will depend on whether - Only the cause of damage has to be rectified or - The structure must be restored to original condition. The designer of the rehabilitation strengthening measures has, therefore, to be very judicious in his approach. When the structural system is complex for accurate analysis, specification more conservative than IRC specification may have to be adopted. The rehabilitation andor strengthening of major bridges is a complex task requiring many a time input from several specialists. The bridge engineer, therefore, has to consult the experts in different fields to work out the appropriate repair plan. Assessment is a complex interaction between structural condition from visual inspection and construction records. Such data can be gathered from investigation of the causes of distress and mechanism of deterioration. Proper preparation and planning are basic requirements to be met in order to carry out professional assessment of distressed bridge. An overview shall be established with typical reasons of deterioration or structural conditions. It shall also include program for various tests. Tests to establish concrete and steel properties considering mechanical and durability aspects shall be carried out. Rate and quantum of corrosion shall be established. Analysis of Cause of Distress Information collected during inspection and investigation data of the bridge structure shall be analyzed. An appropriate protection against the defect cause has to be provided to avoid repetition. An initial concern shall be whether there is any risk of failure of the damaged structure. When there is minor damage, it shall be assessed whether it would aggravate due to service loads. Cost of measures evaluated for rehabilitation, cost of it shall be estimated and incorporated in the budgeting. In case of time dependent damage, estimation of life expectancy is important. Sometimes specification more conservative than the IRC may have to be adopted. The scheme of maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of a bridge would depend upon the following factors. The type of distress is related to the material used in design and construction of various components. There are alternate options to be considered in evaluation and restoration of the damaged structure. 2.2 Type of Structural Form i Arches ii Slab ii GirderBeam and Deck Slab iv Box Cell Bridges v Steel girders with concrete deck slab. 2.3 Distresses Normally Observed Distresses normally observed in these bridges are mentioned below. Cracks could be of Structural andor Non-Structural in nature. The significance of cracks depends on type of the crack, length, width depth, location, nature orientation, type of structure and whether the width and length increase with time and load. Shrinkage cracks occur within first few hours after initial set due to excessive bleeding and rapid early drying. Drying shrinkage cracks take a few weeks to years for development due to loss of moisture. Thermal contraction cracks could result into exposure of reinforcement, seepage and leaking. Alkali aggregate reaction can be a cause of cracks. Corrosion induced cracks are located directly above or below the reinforcement and occur parallel to rebars. Cracks due to sulphate attack may take several years to develop mostly near or below ground level. Physical salt weathering requires many months to many years for development of cracks in the inter tidal and splash zone. Cracks caused by chemical reaction, alkali silica reaction can lead to serious damages to the concrete and loss of strength and capacity. Delamination is separations along a plane parallel to the surface of the concrete. Spall is a depression caused by separation and removal. Major causes of spalling are corrosion of the reinforcement, overstresses, etc. of surface concrete. Leaching is the accumulation of salt and lime deposits white in colour on the concrete surface. Scaling is the manifestation of loss of concrete in patches. Internal voids may not be detected by hammer rap survey. If tapping produces metallic sound then the concrete is sound and well compacted. Twisting of substructure or superstructure units may be evidence of a settlement of foundation problem. Horizontal cracks near the ends of pre-stressed members may indicate a deficiency of reinforcing steel. Vertical crack in the bottom of the unit and at the support may be a result of restricted movement in bearings. Transverse cracks on top of deck in cantilever bridges associated wit. her causes. Leaching is also evidenced in pre-stressed bridges. Particular attention needs to be paid to the concrete or mortar adjacent to joints. Abnormal deflections could also occur due to loss of pre-stress with time. Normally observed defects in steel bridges are i Corrosion ii Excessive vibrations iv Fractures v Distresses in connections, and vi Fatigue cracking. For various distresses in case of steel bridges and remedial measures reference may be made to IRCSP74 and IRCSP75. Abnormal deformations or movements may include i Abnormal vertical deflection ii Abnormal horizontal deflection iv Abnormal vibration due to traffic andor wind. 16IRCSP40-2019 v Chemical or physical attack It may be due to air and moisture, animal wastes, deicing agents. Cracking and splitting of members due to overload, ageing or under-designing of members. Infestations decay etc., due to environmental aggressiveness. Loosening of joints due to lack of good workmanship. Excessive vibration. 3.8 Extradosed bridges Natures of distresses are similar to those referred in clause 3.7 for stay cable described above. 3.9 Suspension bridges Distresses in suspension bridges shall be as per the materials used and have not been enumerated separately. Most of the road bridges built in India are constructed in concrete. Concrete will continue to be the primary construction material for bridges in coming years. Based on research and field experience procedure for testing and diagnosis of concrete bridges has been updated and brought out in this chapter. The occurrence of distress becomes apparent much before the load carrying capacity is adversely affected. Warning signals of distresses are indicated by spalling, rust stains, cracks, excessive deflections, abnormal vibrations, loss of camber. Tests are aimed at assessment of strength and other properties and to locate and obtain comparative results indicating weaker regions, cracks, delaminations and areas of lower integrity than the rest. Details of various tests and their suitability and availability are given in the Table 4.1.

The following decision matrix shall be followed for maintenance, repairs, rehabilitation and strengthening of existing structures. Table 6.2 prescribes the condition of the component of bridge to be categorized in to five groups namely Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor and Critical. 1 Good More than satisfactory Extent of deficiencies Specialized maintenance structural condition is minor Severity of and repairs may be component do not deficiencies is low. 3 Fair Satisfactory structural Extent. of deficiencies, is major Severity and repairs needed soon. State of Distress 4 Poor Structurally deficient Extent of deficiencies R e h a b i l i t a t i o n bridge strengthstability is large Severity of replacement on traffic safety no longer deficiencies is high. Full scale load tests can be expensive and on larger bridges they require considerable planning, involve many people and demand the use of sophisticated equipment. Testing in remote locations can present additional difficulties. Particular care is needed for bridges with brittle fai  load testing can often be justified where the effect of defects and or deterioration on load capacity cannot be determined by analysis alone. A decision to carry out full scale load testing should not be undertaken without a serious thought. Considerable experience is required to know where to locate gauges. Data processing may not be a major consideration. Jacks, duly calibrated, can be used to measure the reactions at the supports of the structure. This may be required for such purpose as assessing the impact of thermal gradients. The criteria for selection of methods, materials and techniques for repairs and strengthening would be governed by the following factors. The maintenance techniques, described in IRCSP35 for inspection and maintenance of bridges, are not repeated. Each case has to be analysed individually and may require special investigations. It is not possible to evolve a general method for repairs andor strengthening of foundations. Most repair works for foundations are in the category of protection and strengthening. Nature of distresses in concrete bridge structure together with important remedial measures in principle are given in Table 5.1. Remedial measures are indicated according to component of the bridge and distressed observed. Given the wide range of materials and repairs techniques the choice of the most appropriate technique is difficult. Concrete Restoration By Hand applied mortar, Spraying of mortar Guniting, Sprays of concrete Shotcreting, Recasting of concrete, Replacement of old element by new one. Structural Strengthening By Addition of new reinforcement externally. Bonding of steel plates, Wrapping Bonding by Fiber Reinforced Plastic FRP.

Damages include Replacement Bearings embrittlement of elastomer Cracking and tearing. Cracking dead by steel plates, FRP or external dormant, spalling and prestressing damage to Concrete. Excessive scour is one of the major factors that may cause or lead to structural failure or distress of the foundation. The degree of damage depends on factors such as stream bed material, intensity of discharge, silt charge and obliquity of stream flow. Spur dykes, jetties, deflectors and other measures may be constructed to deviate water away from a fill, bridge pier, or abutment. Piers and abutments may be protected or repaired by placing sheet piling. In some cases, the footing may be extended by using sheet piling as forms for the extension. Around piers it is common to provide what is known as garlanding technique. In this, very heavy concrete blocks or stones of designed size and weight are placed around the pier foundations. The bearing capacity of the soil can be increased by injecting cement or chemical grout such that grout pressure does not exceed the overburden pressures. Rock or ground anchors are often used for erosion around abutments. Underwater inspection is very difficult because of the harsher environment, poor visibility, deposition of marine organisms etc. To do an effective underwater 33IRCSP40-2019 inspection, it is necessary to deploy properly trained and equipped personnel. After identification of the damage, it may be necessary either to expose the member by means of a cofferdam and dewatering or by providing a small air-lock. In some cases sophisticated techniques, ultra-sonic thickness gauges, computerized tomography or TV monitors may be used. Placing of concrete under water can be carried out with the help of conventional underwater buckettremie concrete, pre-packed concrete, bagged concrete or pumped concrete. Methods used to perform underwater sealing and repairing of cracks by suitable grout injections are similar to methods used above water. The sealer is used for restoring the strength of the cracked concrete pier or pile instead of simply blocking the free entry of water in the crack. Various methods used to prevent the corrosion of steel piling in sea water, include application of protective coatings. Some of the defects and remedial measures for stone or brick masonry arch bridges are given below. 34IRCSP40-2019 i Loss of Bond for the Crown Key Stone Flat jacks can be used for pushing the stone back to its original position. ii Longitudinal Cracks along the Direction of Traffic. Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix FRCM can also be used to strengthen the bridge by means of wrapping. Transverse Cracks Injection of, polymer or suitable grout as per size of cracks will provide a good bond between stones and brick masonry. Helical stainless steel ties and bars have good axial strength combined with sufficient lateral flexibility. Helical reinforcement can be used for minimizing movement in spandrel walls, separation of brick arch rings, cracking in arch barrel, delaminated masonry. Normal concrete placing techniques are satisfactory. Replacement backfill may be with normal or lightweight concrete. The latter will reduce dead load on the foundations but may also reduce the factor of safety for stability of the substructure. 36IRCSP40-2019 Economical system with no maintenance. Suitable for enhancing flexural, shear and compressive strength. Low thickness with a minimum increase of the cross-section on the structure."

        "prompt": "Summarize the following section: Chapter 6",
        "response": "Problems with concrete decks in composite structures are essentially of the same kind and order of magnitude as those found in concrete decks. Difficulties may be encountered with deck replacement or even major deck rehabilitation and strengthening operations in those composite bridges. Bridge decks can be replaced by new concrete decks or by new orthotropic steel decks. Bolting is the preferred method of connecting the new deck system to existing structural members. Strengthening of plate girders can be done by adding stiffness to flanges, webs and diaphragms. Cracks can be due to any one or a combination of the following reasons. High stress concentrations jointslocation due to in appropriate detailing or loose connections may be avoided by champher. Increased traffic loading 37IRCSP40-2019. Poor workmanship v Reduction in strength due to corrosion. Cracks should be examined in detail by NDT tests like magnifying glass, dye penetration, ultrasonic etc. Photographs and videos may be taken and appropriately labeled. Underwater Welding Arc or gas welding is commonly used in underwater repairs. The idea is that a light arch can carry a significant load if properly supported laterally. In this case, the truss with its cross-beams provided the lateral support. The arch in combination with the hangars and additional floor beams provides the increased load carrying capacity. Arch superposition scheme can be considered as an overall strengthening measure. Increase in dead load can be expected to be in order of approximately 15 to 20 percent. Slender arch contributes only modest amounts of additional stiffness to the truss. The condition of the existing concrete in the exposed area is of primary importance in the durability of the repair. It is important that the contact surface to be repaired is in hard and sound condition. In general, all foreign loose soft damaged and fractured concrete materials are removed. The choice of a suitable method depends on the type, location, extent and severity of distress as well as the thickness of the layer of the damage in the structure. Mechanical equipment is preferable, as it is more intensive, reliable and speedy. The thermal and chemical methods are rarely used and are restricted to special circumstances. High pressure water-jet the pressure 40 to 40IRCSP40-2019 120 MPa at the jet is most efficient for removal of soft areas of the concrete surface. In hydro-jet method, with the jet pressure at 140 240 MPa a deep penetration into the concrete or even cutting grooves is possible. General Bonding agents are recommended to improve the bond between old concrete and the repair concrete. A cement mortar consisting of equal parts of cement and sand along with water of requisite viscosity may be used as bonding agent. In most cases, both types of bonding exist in combination. The bonding effect depends on the type of polymeradditive being used. There are two basic types of bonding agents made of resins. The first case consists of a combination of a water emulsified epoxy, resin, a polyamide resin hardener and a filling material. Filling materials prevent a deep penetration of resin into the old concrete. The durability of a structural element cannot be assessed only from the physical appearance of its surface. The composition of the external surface layers is comparatively different from the interior of the structural element. There is a difference in how protection is achieved from impregnation systems and sealers and or coating systems. The efficiency of an impregnation basically depends on the preparation of the surface. The absorption is accomplished via the capillary voids of the concrete. The application may be accomplished by means of a brush, lambskin roller or by spraying. Impregnation protection systems are only suitable where the concrete surface will not be removed by abrasion, damaged or locally affected by the formation of cracks. While impregnation with resins may be successfully used on horizontal surfaces, hydrophobizing impregnations are not suitable for horizontal surfaces. C Coatings is a treatment to produce a continuous protective layer on the surface of the concrete. The materials for coatings to be used shall be organic inorganic polymers such as Acrylics, Epoxy, PU, PMMA or Silicone Resins. Piers above the tidal zone and the superstructures are best coated with Anti-Carbonation Acrylic, Elastic-Elastomeric coating. The coating should have anti carbonation and water vapor diffusion property and should be resistant to action of UV radiation. Oating protects exposed faces of the superstructure and the substructure of concrete bridges from the aggressive action of industrially polluted and marinesaline environment. The specifications of the coating can be taken from IRCSP80 or from MORTH - Specifications for Road Bridge Works. Pre-treatment of surface is of prime importance while using shotcrete. Sand blasting has proved to be an efficient surface treatment procedure. Environmental protection regulations should be verified before use. The surface should be sufficiently pre-moisten. No bonding agent is necessary because at the interface surface, mortar enrichment occurs. Minimum reinforcement may be required for thicknesses larger than 50 mm. Curing may be accomplished by an evaporation protection, e.g. plastic sheet. Shotcrete suitable for normal construction requirements can be produced by either process. Special variants of shotcretes result from the addition of polymers, fibers or of synthetic resins. Steel, glass boron-silicate-glass and plastics are used for the fibers. The removal of damaged concrete is usually done with electrically powered or compressed air ensuring that the reinforcement is not damaged. Hydro demolition is the latest method where water is sprayed on to the concrete in thin sheets. The last layer must not contain steel fibers. The replacement of concrete in larger continuous areas should proceed in the same manner as during the construction of the concrete structure. Placing concrete in the area to be repaired should be accomplished in such a manner as not to impede concrete flow. The replacement concrete should have final properties that match the existing concrete as closely as possible. The type of cement, cement content and the watercement ratio should be carefully evaluated. The use of plasticizers is recommended. Re-compaction re-vibration may be required to improve the contact to the old concrete. Cracks may occur due to creep, shrinkage, fatigue, fire, non-functioning of bearing, temperature gradient, chlorination and carbonation. Repair of cracks becomes necessary when Corrosion protection is at risk allowing corrosive agents to reach reinforcing steel. A crack resulting from one time load application and which has ceased to propagate can be repaired by pressure injection with epoxy resins. The material used for crack repair must be such as to penetrate easily into the crack and also provide a durable adhesion to the crack surfaces. Cement paste is relatively inexpensive, its use is limited to crack widths around 0.3 mm Improvement of workability will be obtained if the cement suspension is introduced into the mix with high speed mixers. The repair techniques generally applicable for the various types of damages and cracking of concrete are as follows. Packer Packers are auxiliary means by which the injection material is filled into the crack. Depending on the method of installation, they may be classified as an adhesive packer and drilling packer. Adhehe may be insidesurface injection grouting. Fig. 6.2 shows various types of packers in practice as below. Packer consists of a threaded metal tube which is encased in a rubber like sleeve and equipped with a nut. After insertion into the drill hole, the rubber sleeve is compressed by screwing down the nut. The influence of the applied pressure on the packer, the tamping and the crack itself should be considered. Errors in mixing two- component resins can have significant effect on the hardening of the resin. Injection pressure depends on various parameters such as tensile strength of concrete, depth and width of crack, viscosity of injection material. The injection of a crack is completed when either the resin or hardener has been consumed from either of the containers or a back pressure has built.  core drilling and ultrasonic testing. shall be carried out by and experienced and trained applicator. Adequate materials, equipment and experience of the operating personnel are an essential requirement for the successful injection of cracks. Some resin manufacturers have contracted with independent institutions to provide testing on a statistical sampling basis as a monitoring control. After successful testing, the resin batches are provided with a stamp of the testing institute as well as with information regarding durability. Epoxy resins can be successfully utilized when the temperature of the structural element is not less than 8C. For relatively hot structural elements, as compared to normal temperatures, a considerable reduction in the workability time of the resins may result. There is a cyclic width variation, as result of traffic loading, during injection and hardening, provided this variation does not exceed 0.05mm. Appropriate traffic limitations upto maximum of the first three days depending on temperature should be implemented. Stitching across the cracks by in-situ reinforced concrete is done either along the cracks or a series of bands around the members. Jacketing involves fastening of external material over the concrete to provide the required performance characteristics. The embedment of reinforcing steel in concrete normally provides adequate corrosion protection due to the alkalinity of the concrete surrounding the steel. Some of the latest techniques include use of special chemical material formulations to satisfy the requirements like high tensile strength. In the absence of moisture i.e., dry concrete the corrosion process is inhibited. When reinforcement corrodes to a certain extent, the surrounding concrete cover tends to expand and leads to crack and spall or split. Non-expansive black rust associated with severe pitting and rapid corrosion can occur in low oxygen wet high chloride conditions. The decision on the necessity or removal of chloride contaminated concrete cover shall depend upon the amount of chloride content, availability of moisture and degree of carbonation. The removal of rust from the uncovered reinforcing steel is generally accomplished by mechanical methods and hydro jetting or needle hammer and wire brushing. Active coatings for reinforcement contain Portland cement or electrochemically active pigments, which may function as inhibitors or which may provide localized cathodic protection. Typical product that can be used is a one- component polymer modified mineral based corrosion protection coat. The Cathodic Protection CP technique has been adopted to protect steel pipe lines and tanks from corrosion. In the. case where concrete cover is thin it may be desirable to seal the surface with an epoxy resin and solvent. containing acrylic resins to prevent carbonation or corrosion. The potential shift produced by the DC is critical to the cathodic protection. Because of the high resistivity of the electrolyte concrete a uniform distribution of the protection current throughout the structure is necessary. But difficulties in achieving this and high costs have prevented cathodic Protection being widely used in bridge decks. Pre-stressing steel should be protected by the concrete cover and the cement grout in the ducts. A carful drilling procedure is required to avoid damaging of the pre- stressing steel. Vacuum grouting techniques can be used to fill in voids. The repair must be accomplished as quickly as possible after opening of the duct to avoid corrosion. After grouting, a pressure has to be applied to expel residual air from the voids. There is a risk that for large air cushions, setting water will be displaced towards defects. The pre-stressing steel of external tendons is protected by a tight envelope of plastic pipe or painted steel pipe. The internal void of the pipe is filled with cement grout or suitable greases. Some paintings, coating materials and special grouting mortars might contain substances that can produce stress corrosion. Porous zones of the structure must be carefully removed. Then they are replaced by fully compacted concrete or mortar. This procedure cannot be used where there is a continuing inflow of water. In this case, sealing can be accomplished by injection or use of underwater epoxyresins. The new load bearing material will usually be High quality grade concrete. The main problem associated in strengthening is to achieve compatibility and continuity in the structural behaviour between the original materialstructure and the new materialrepaired structure. The strengthening of structures should be designed and constructed in accordance with related codes. Many problems in connection with strengthening are not dealt with in the codes. Typical problems of this kind are the transfer of shear forces between the old concrete and the new concrete applied for strengthening reinforcement and the post-tensioning of the existing structure. The joint must be durable i.e., the composite structural component must not change its mode of action with time in existing changed environment. Temperature differences can be limited by special measures, either, pre-heating of the old structural element andor cooling of the fresh concrete. Vibrations due to traffic during hardening of the new concrete will have either negative influences or positive influences on its strength and its bond characteristics to the old concrete. This will depend on whether the vibrations are just sufficient to harden the concrete or too severe to disturb the components of hardened concrete. Traffic shall be permitted only after complete settinghardening of fresh material. The form work should be so detailed that no relative movement occurs between old and new concrete. The reinforcement has to be sufficiently fastened so as to keep relative displacement small. Reinforcement should be added after reducing locked up stresses to the extent possible. The severely damaged reinforcing bars must be replaced. This can either be done by providing sufficient anchorage length for the steel in the concrete, or by steel plates and bolts with anchoring discs. After unloading of the structure, the damaged sections of the corroded bar can be removed and the new reinforcing bar joined. The load carrying capacity of this type of strengthening depends on the strength of the reinforcement, the concrete and the adhesive. Geometrical influences are primarily the dimension of the reinforcing elements. Concrete strength has a large influence on the efficiency of the strengthening. There is no proportionality between the width of the glued element and ultimate load, as an increase of width results in a reduction of bond strength. With increasing width, there is a risk of defects in the adhesive. Suitable conditions can be achieved by sand blasting or by suitable method. The strengthening of concrete structures can be achieved by means of bonded plates. When the steel plate is bonded to concrete with epoxy adhesive the structural behaves will be composite structure. Priming with zinc dust or hot-dip galvanizing is not suitable for glued on reinforcing elements. Fiber Reinforced Plastic Bonding is an extension of the steel plate bonding technique. The rapid acceptance of this material is due to serviceability and ease of application without disturbing the structure. The FRCM. material system is similar to the CFRP Strengthening system, with only the matrix being a cementitious material, instead of an epoxy. This system addresses many of the shortcomings of the. CFRP system. The system undergoes ductile failure like steel reinforced concrete and not brittle failure as in CFRP. Fine grained blasting materials have proved to be effective minimum pull-off strength 1.5N mm2. Coarse grained materials will achieve a deeper roughening of the concrete surface, which results in an increased consumption of adhesive. Water sensitivity varies widely between various adhesives. Epoxy resinadhesive have a certain porosity, which will allow the penetration of water and other solutions. Fatigue strength is approximately 50 of the short-term strength. In correctly designed structures with bonded plate re. ad has been applied, the static ultimate strength of the concrete structure with glued on reinforcement increases. This can be explained through a reduction of the bond stress speaks as a result of dynamic load. 6.2.1 General In many cases, strengthening by means of external pre-stressing is a highly effective method. Both reinforced concrete and pre- stressed concrete structures can be strengthened by this method. Ning systems should comply with the 59IRCSP40-2019 requirements of the IRC codes for Acceptance and Applications of Post-Tensioning Systems. Both bonded and un-bonded tens can be used. If short pre-stressing elements are required, a post-tensioning system with minimal slipping should be chosen. The stress in an unbounded tendon in the ultimate state will be only slightly larger than that after pre-stress losses. The post-tensioning tendons should be protected against corrosion and fire to the same extent as in a newly built structure. Transverse pre-stressing creates contact pressure between new and original concrete. The necessary shear stresses can be transferred through the joint. To ensure full interaction between the tendons and the rest of the structure, the same method can be used along the entire beam. Anchorages at existing diaphragms require extensive coring such that the tendon can be anchored at the backside. A large radius of tendon curvature should be used. Deviators or deviation saddles or deflectors have to be provided. Strengthening is also possible by adding precast elements. This method will require a distressing unloading of the original section. This provides an improved transmission of pre- stress force throughout the composite section. In the fabrication of the precast elements, consideration should be given to the texture of the contact surface so as to provide increased bonding and shear characteristics at the interface. A sufficiently rough surface can be obtained by early removal of the formwork and cleaning with water. To roughen the surface, sand blasting is also suitable. A self-equilibrated stress condition can be induced in the structure by relative displacement raising andor lowering of the supports. It is important to note that relieving some sections of the structure will increase action effects bending moment, shear, torsion etc in other sections. Operational life of expansion joints, bearings, footpaths and railings is usually shorter than that of the bridge. The capacity and efficiency of bearings may be a limiting factor in situations where it is required to increase the load carrying capacity of a bridge. The seals of the joints usually serve for 10 to 12 years with normal maintenance and may need replacement over a period of time. Based on the experience gained in India as well as in other countries, it may be reasonable to assume life of expansion joints around 20 years. It is not uncommon for joints to be watertight under the roadway but allow water to leak through at the kerb. Joints may be filled with a sealant or filler. The filler material must be designed to ensure water tightness. Debris may prevent joint movement if the filler fails. Damage to finger type joints can manifest in the form of bent, cracked, corroded, broken, closure of gaps and jamming. Reasons can be due to traffic or movement of bituminous wearing 64IRCSP40-2019 course, poor alignment and loose anchorages. Bearings are vital elements of the bridge and need regular inspection and maintenance. Bearings may be affected by Manufacture, defective materials, inadequate design or improper installation. Table 5.2 may be referred to for defects and possible replacement. Excessive tilting or collapse of cut rollers. Shearing off of lugs. Corrosion of rollers and plates. Seizure of bearing plates. Tears, cracks or splits in neoprene material. Breaking of guide plates. Improper installation of bearing of any type. Displacement of PTFE in pot bearings. In all events of lifting, checking the design of superstructure for stresses induced due to lifting is obligatory. These specialized activities shall only be undertaken by specialist agencies. Where superstructure is very heavy, cranes may have to be used. Oblique flow of the stream under the bridges, the angle of obliquity being more than that assumed in the design. Meandering of the river and flow concentration in few spans may adversely affect stability of bridge. If actual waterway provided is inadequate, river may overflow the banks. Floods can damage the bridge structure as well as the approaches and the protective measures. The bridge engineer is advised to refer to IRC89 Guidelines for Design and Construction of River Training and Control Works for Road Bridges. The superstructure can be raised with the help of jacks and extending the sub-structure in suitable stages by successfully resting them on the precast concrete pads which can then be embedded in the raised height of the piers. If the bridge deck is not to be raised but the bridge has to be protected from floods higher than the design floods, then designing the bridge as a submersible one and strengthening If floods attack one side of the bridge, then additional spans could be provided on the affected side. Sometimes such situation can be handled by adequately designed spurs or groynes. Surfaces of concrete or masonry can get eroded by high velocity of stream and sometimes cavitation can occur. It is essential that the structure is inspected periodically and its condition monitored regularly. The various methods of monitoring the bridge structures are given in the succeeding paragraphs. Use of hydraulic model studies for specific problems is also of considerable help in arriving at a proper solution. Routine inspections should be carried out at more intervals than normal structures. The usual methods adopted for monitoring the behaviour of a structure are a. Observing deflections by periodically taking levels. b Visual observations for cracks, deflections, o Particular note must be made of the cracking pattern, their width and length and whether cracks can be due to plastic shrinkage, settlements, structural deficiency, reactive aggregates, and corrosion. Signs of delamination, spalling, hollow or dead sound when tapped with hammer, honeycombing and expansion of concrete should also be observed. Use of current density or rebar probes and the use of corrosion rate monitoring probes can be made to meet the particular requirements. Careful selection of permanent monitoring equipment is required. The locations should be minimum and should be at the area of most active corrosion rate. System consists of threading a laser beam through series of apertures in the plates fixed along the length of the beam. Electronic strain gauges are fixed at predetermined points. Failure of beam in reaching the receiver requires further investigation. The system could be made by attaching detectors to the structure along the path of the laser beam. Any movement of the structure at the location of each detector would be continuously tracked by the latter. Measurements for vibration characteristics of a structure can also be adopted in some cases. Maintaining distressed bridges as well as rehabilitated bridges requires a great deal of skill and specialization. Monitoring also requires setting up a data bank as a reference frame. Testing, measurements and analysis of data are important to monitor the condition of the bridges. There are certain important aspects of rehabilitation and strengthening of bridges involving measures other than technical which deserve due attention at various stages by concerned authorities. Monitoring shall also be augmented by continuous research and development. The morale of the engineers in charge of the work has to be maintained since they would be carrying out such repairs at a great risk to their own safety. Provision must be made in structures at the design stage itself for the possibility of future interventions. The new materials and techniques shall be used for Maintenance, Repair, Rehabilitation and strengthening with utmost care and due diligence with respect to the specifications, method of application and quality control promoter in addition to the respective IRC codes. Carbonation Depth Test, and Salt-scaling Test by Tarun R. Naik Report No. CBU-2004-18 REP-566, 2004 10. Carbonation in Concrete and Effect on Steel Corrosion by Prof. Alberto A.

Carino, CRC Press, 2004. 17. Petrographic Analysis of Con concrete Deterioration by Dr. Mathew Stuart, 2016. 18. Electrochemical techniques for measuring metallic corrosion in concrete. The various testing methods for assessment of the bridges are described below. Although brief procedure is also provided it for background information and for detailed procedure corresponding latest code as mentioned in Table 4.1 shall be referred. Carbonation of concrete occurs when the carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere in the presence of moisture, reacts with hydrated cement compounds. The carbonation process is also called depassivation. The depth of carbonation is measured by spraying on the freshly broken surface of concrete with 0.10 solution of phenolphthalein. The concrete undergoes, a colour change from pink to colourless when PH value is below 10. The measurement of carbonation depth using the phenolphthalein solution can be carried out by spraying the indicator on the split surface of the concrete cylinder or cor. A carbonation depth up to an accuracy of 5 mm can be identified with the naked eye. It directly gives the effective cover available to the reinforcement before the start of corrosion. Factors affecting the test results are i. Humidity- Higher humidity results in greater carbonation process. ii. Temperature - The carbonation reaction rate increases with temperature. i. Low Rain Precipitation- When The normal concentration of CO in the atmosphere 2 2 is approximately 0.03. However, in certain areas as in bridges with heavy traffic, or close to industrial areas, the level of CO contamination may reach and 2 even exceed 0.1 concentration. The concrete attached by sulphate has a characteristic white appearance. The carbon dioxide could react at the depths greater than those indicated by the indicator. The test shall not be considered as a tool for estimating the structural properties of the reinforced concrete member. Add 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and then add drop wise to the boiling solution 10 ml of the barium chloride solution. Boil gently for 5 min, keep the solution at just below boiling for 30 min and allow to stand at room temperature for 12 hrs. to 24 hrs. Filter through a slow ashless filter paper and wash free from chlorides with hot water. Transfer the paper and contents to a weighed silica or platinum cruc The cement content of the sample used in L is the mass of ignited barium sulphate in g. Salts of thiocyanates and thiosulphates are increasingly used as accelerating admixtures in place of chlorides. These compounds can interfere with the determination of chloride content. Chloride content will be determined, the presence of acid soluble chlorides in concrete beyond the permissible limits is considered as a corrosion hazard in concrete structures. The chloride iron content J as a percentage of the cement to the nearest 0.01 mm from the expression. The Schmidt Rebound Hammer test is used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in an existing structure and as a quality control measure of a new construction. The main components of the equipment include the outer body, the plunger, the hammer mass, and the main spring. Rapid tests for in-situ chloride determination are being developed. The mass hits the shoulder of the plunger rod and rebounds because the rod is pushed hard against the concrete. During rebound the slide indicator travels with the hammer mass and stops at the maximum distance the mass reaches after rebounding. A minimum of 3-5 concrete cores preferably of size 150 mm Ø x 300 mm are extracted from different locations of the structure. After capping, cores are placed in a compression-testing machine under an initial load of approximately 15 of the ultimate load to restrain the specimen. A correlation is then developed between the average rebound numbers and the core compressive strength by fitting a curve or a line by the method of least squares. This correlation may be used to estimate the compressed strength of concrete in the structure at different locations from average rebound hammer. About 16 hammer rebound readings are taken, 4 on each of sides, avoiding testing the same spot twice. A correlation is then developed between the average rebound numbers and the cube compressive strength by fitting a curve or a line by the method of least squares. The method gives only the surface hardness but does not give direct estimation of compressive strength. A correlation curve, specific to the concrete in the structure, is required to be developed to correlate the rebound number to compressive concrete strength. The probable accuracy of estimation of concrete strength in a structure is 25. Cover meters are used to detect steel reinforcement bars and estimate concrete cover over rebar and diameter of the steel reinforcement bar in concrete structures. The method works on electro-magnetic principles. An electromagnetic field is generated by the search head of the meter. Cover-meters can measure the cover with an accuracy of 5 mm up to a depth of about 75 mm. It is possible to obtain the location of reinforcing steel bar, determine the depth of concrete cover and estimate the barsize using the cover meters. The technique is the least complicated and least expensive of all the NDT techniques. Under the most favourable site conditions, indicated cover can be measured to an accuracy or 1 to 4 mm approaching that obtainable in the laboratory when the bar size is known. Ground Penetrating Radar GPR is the electromagnetic analogue of sonic and ultrasonic pulse echo methods. GPR can be used for locating the reinforcement, embedded cables and ducts in a bridge structure. It is also used for profiling the bottom of lakes and rivers, and measuring scouring around bridge foundations etc. Ground radar surveys are used on bridge structures for assisting load assessments and as a follow-up to routine inspections. The radar waves can never penetrate through metals, so testing the interior of metal ducts, e.g. for un-grouted areas is not possible. Radar may fail to locate small delaminated areas, especially those that are only 0.3 m wide or less. The amount of radiation lost depends on the quality of radiation, the density of the material and the thickness traversed. Most of the applications involve transmission of wave energy rather than reflection or refraction methods. The emerging radiation is detected by photographic emulsion or by a radiation detector. The Principle of Radiography is shown in Fig. A5. The back-scatter techniques is based on intensity of x-rays. It can be used to detect voids in grouts and testing strands or wires which are broken or are out of position. The relationship between the intensity of photons incident and transmitted is I I eµx 0. The penetrating ability of portable x-ray units is limited and is used for members less than 300 mm thick. Major disadvantage is the health risk associated with the radiation. High degree of skill and experience is required for exposure and interpretation. The equipment is relatively expensive. The method works on the principle that discontinuity within the concrete, such as delamination, interrupts the heat transfer through concrete. Radiation is incident on the surface and that is reflected or absorbed. If this radiation falls on a concrete surface, then if the delaminations or the void was not there, then lot of radiation will simply get absorbed into the concrete. Infrared thermography provides a two dimensional image i.e. Thermographs of the test surface showing the extent of subsurface anomalies like presence of voids, delaminations and occurrence of spalling. The main advantage of infrared thermography is that it is an area testing technique. The presence of voids or spalling can be found out but not the depth. This technique is mostly used for assessment of the cracks, anomalies and spalling on the concrete surface. Higher resolution cameras with continuous plots of bridge deck are possible to do a very fast analysis.  ultrasonic pulse velocity taking into account time passing through testing base and length of the same as follows T L V In short the procedure is as under i.e. concrete can be assessed by passing through concrete the ultra-sonic pulse and measuring its velocity. The methods of propagating ultrasonic pulses are given in Fig. A8 below 86IRCSP40-2019. The time taken by the signal in order to travel and reach the receiver is the result that will be showed on the UPV which is Velocity. Based on the test result Quality of Concrete can be categorized based on velocity. UPV Testing has the possible solution to judge the porosity, density, strength of concrete section. Generalised correlations are not suitable to define strength of the concrete sample. Co-relation can are more reliable if both test element and compressive strength test specimens are of similar size. Endoscopy consists of usually flexible viewing tubes which can be inserted into holes drilled in the bridge components or into a cable duct of the pre-stressed concrete. The endoscopes are available with attachments for a camera or a TV Monitor and are used for detailed examination of parts of the bridge structure which cannot otherwise be assessed. The endoscope inspection is a reliable method for assessing the conditions of the post-tensioning tendons. The method is invasive but the damage induced to the tendons and deck is minimal. It is also useful for detail examination of other part of the bridge structure. Acoustic emissions can be detected in frequency ranges under 1 kHz. Most of the released energy is within the 1 kHz to 1 MHz range. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz, and typically falling off at several MHz. AE relies on energy that is initiated within the component or material under test. Sensors are coupled to the structure by means of a fluid couplant and are secured with tape, adhesive bonds or magnetic hold downs. Acoustic Emission can be used at all stages of testing which include pre-service Proof testing, in service Re-qualification testing, on-line monitoring of components and system, leak detection and location, and in-process weld monitoring. The basic principle for obtaining strength of core is the ratio of Maximum load applied to the Cross-Sectional Area. The necessary equipments are given in Fig. A11 which consist of i Grinding equipment, ii Steel collar and iv Compression testing machine. The standard procedure is briefly given below. Record the maximum load. move any water, loose sand or other material from the ends of the core. Normal failures are reasonably symmetrical. Note any unusual failures and the appearance of the concrete. Compressive strength of each core by dividing the maximum. load by the cross-sectional area, calculated from the average diameter. The presence of reinforcement, cracked or loose caps in cores may affect the strength. This test method is more reliable while comparing other partially destructive test and visual inspection to assess concrete uniformity aggregate distribution compaction. Core samples can be used for petrography or chemical analysis. The Galvano-static Pulse Transient method is used to determine the instantaneous corrosion rate of reinforcing steel in concrete. The basic principle is the same as that of LPR method galviano-static perturbation, however this is a transient polarization technique working in the time domain. A short time anodic current pulse is impressed to reinforcement galvano-statically. The reinforcement is polarized in anodic direction compared to its free corrosion potential. The resulting change of the electrochemical potential of the reinforcement is recorded. The data obtained is analysed with the help of a Randels electric circuit. The I and i are then calculated as detailed in LPR p corr corr test method. Commercially available equipments directly display the icorr. Corrosion current density is obtained from which the corrosion rate can be estimated. The galvanostatic pulse transient technique can be used to assess the present corrosion condition of the reinforcement. It may also be used. to evaluate the effectiveness of a repair work. The electrode half-cell, Fig. A14b potential of reinforcement embedded in concrete provides a measure of the corrosion risk. Measured potential difference between the reference electrode and the steel rebar is empirically related to the corrosion risk. The measurements are interpreted as per ASTM C 876. Commercial equipment based on the above method is available. Test measurements may be presented by one or both of two methods. e-This is necessary if the half-cell reading fluctuates with time when it is placed in contact with the concrete. Potential risks of corrosion based on potential difference readings are shown. Method is simple. It allows an almost non-destructive survey to be made to produce iso- potential contour maps of the surface of the concrete member. Zones of varying degrees of corrosion risk may be identified from these maps. HammerChains can be used to locate delaminations in concrete bridge decks. The operator drags chains or strikes a hammer on the deck, listening to the resulting sound. The hollow sound is a result of the flexural oscillations of the delaminated section of the deck. Tapping the bridge deck surface with a steel rod or hammer is adopted in place of the chain drag. Marked areas can be mapped on a grid or placed in drawingmapping software for output as shown in Fig. A17. Solid concrete will produce a ringing sound, while concrete that is spalled, delaminated, or contains voids will produced a flat or hollo sound. This test method is not applicable on concrete decks overlaid with the bituminous concrete or on frozen concrete. The variable field conditions such as traffic noise, vibration, moisture content of the concrete may affect the results. The impact-echo technique is based on generating a short-duration, low frequency, stress pulse by mechanical impact on a concrete surface. The pulse propagates into the member along spherical wave fronts as P and S waves. These waves are reflected by the boundaries of, internal interfaces or flaws in the concrete member. Steel spheres are convenient impact sources because they produce well-defined pulses approximately a half-cycle sine curves. Conically tipped, piezoelectric displacement transducers are used as the receiver. The data acquisition system may be a digital waveform analyzer, a portable computer with data acquisition hardware and software. Impact-Echo Method 98IRCSP40-2019 is based on honey combing. The method is not influenced by traffic noise or low frequency structural vibrations set up by normal movement of traffic across a structure. The results are obtained in the form the thickness of the concrete members. Impact-echo is more reliable when relatively small areas are delaminated so as to indicate early signs of deterioration. Commercial equipment on impact echo is available to determine the thickness of the concrete bridge deck slabs. Wireless echo system is also available from some manufacturers for use of inspection team with limited man-power. The method works on the principle that the polarization resistance of a corroding system is inversely proportional to its corrosion rate. The polarization resistance is determined 99IRCSP40-2019 either by applying a small voltage 10- 20 mV and measuring the resulting change in current. The polarization resistance, R , of the steel is calculated from the equation p R EI p. The corrosion rate, I , is then calculated as follows corr I BRp corr. A value of 25 mV has been adopted for active corroding steel and 50 mV for passive non-corroding steel. A guard ring electrode is used which prevents the perturbation current from the auxiliary electrode spreading beyond a known area. The actual loss of steel is calculated using Faradays laws as per ASTM G 102. The equipment directly displays the corrosion current density i when the diameter of the bar corr is fed into the equipment. The method can be applied regardless of the thickness of concrete cover and the rebar size or detailing. It is very suitable for on-site condition assessment of steel reinforcement w.r.t corrosion in concrete structures. Limitations are iThis method assesses only the instantaneous condition of the steel reinforcement, but cannot predict its future condition. Method can be used to assess the present corrosion condition of the reinforcement, that is, to discriminate between corroding and non-corroding passivated zones. It may also be used. to evaluate the effectiveness of a repair work. tain or the method gives misleading results. The Windsor probe consists of a powder-actuated gun or driver, hardened alloy steel probes, loaded cartridges, a depth gauge for measuring the penetration of probes, and other related equipment. Probe penetration relates to some property of the concrete below the surface, and within limits, it has been possible to develop empirical correlations between strength properties and the probe. The power level can be reduced by pushing the driver head further into the barrel. The area to be tested must have a brush finish or a smooth surface as it affects the result. The evaluation of test can be done only after a co-relation is established. If any of the three probes fails to properly penetrate the slab, remove it and fire another. Plot the exposed probe length against the compressive strength, and fit a curve or line. The 95 confidence limits for individual results may also be drawn on the graph. The minimum acceptable distance from a test location to any edges of the concrete member or between two test locations is of the order of 150 mm to 200 mm. The minimum thickness of the member, which can be tested, is about three times the expected depth of probe penetration. The test is limited to 40 MPa. Permeability is a property that governs the rate of flow of fluid into a porous solid. In case of concrete, it can be used to characterize its transport properties that link to its durability. This test is used to determine the permeability of concrete in-situ. Not all methods have been adopted as standard test procedures. The following Table A T2 lists most of the test methods available as standards developed for the three transport mechanisms. The air permeability test is carried out first and then the water permeable test is done on the same specimen. Determination of air permeability of concrete is useful to assess its state of compaction, presence of bleed voids and channels. Oxygen Permeability Index Test Oxygen. German Water Permeation GWT Test Water. BS EN 12390-2009 Water. Good correlation between Oxygen Permeability Index OPI values recorded at 28 days and carbonation depths after natural exposure were reported. Instruments for testing water permeability on-site usually consist of a reservoir filled with water, which is connected to the concrete surface. Most of the laboratory methods consist of subjecting a mortar or concrete specimen of known dimensions to a known hydrostatic pressure. The test permits measurement of the water entering the specimen as well as that leaving it. Moisture conditions concrete mix aggregate surface finish and type curing, age of concrete, cracking, water type and temperature may affect the permeability. Some tests are completed in 10-15 minutes after preparation and condition. Other tests need longer times from 1-3 days, or more. The methods do not measure permeability directly but provide a Permeability Index or permeability coefficient. The method involves visual examination of polished slabs under a binocular microscope, followed by detailed examination of thin sections under a polarizing microscope. n aggregates react with the soluble alkaline components of the cement paste. There are two main forms of alkali-aggregate reaction. Petrographic Investigation Flow Chart Samples for petrographic examination can be taken from lump samples or cores. Samples of mortar are impregnated with epoxy resin and sawn. The sections are prepared by careful grinding and polishing in a non-aqueous media. The polished surfaces are studied with at least 50x 106IRCSP The results of a petrography analysis are used to establish the quality of the concrete. Broken fragments of concrete are generally not use in petrographic examination, because the damage to the concrete cannot be clearly identified as a function of the sampling technique. The Pull-Out Test is based on the principle that the force required to pull out a cone of steel embedded in concrete is proportional to the strength of concrete. The method is also commonly used when repairing buildings of historical significance.  selected test surface shall be flat for drilling the core and undercutting the groove. Drill a core hole perpendicular to the surface to provide a reference point for subsequent operations. Use the expansion tool to position the expandable insert into the groove and expand the insert to its proper size.  pull out tests are used to estimate the in-place strength of concrete to establish whether it has reached a specified level. The disadvantage of the pull out test is that it causes small damage to the concrete is required to be repaired. Post-installed pullout tests may be used to estimate the strength of concrete in existing construction. Pullout test can be used advantageously for inaccessible areas and section having dense rebar placement. Resistivity measurement is useful for identifying areas of reinforced concrete at risk from corrosion. The equipment consists of four electrodes two outer current probes and two inner voltage probes which are placed in a straight line on or just below the concrete surface at equal spacing. A low frequency alternating electrical current is passed between the two outer electrodes whilst the voltage drop between the inner electrodes is measured. For evaluating susceptibility of rebar corrosion in the given environment concrete matrix. Resistivity measurement is a fast, simple and cheap in situ non-destructive method to obtain information related to the corrosion hazard of embedded reinforcement. The Transient Dynamic Response Test can be used to locate delamination, cracking or loss of integrity in concrete. In principle, for each step, the wave from an incident pulse travels through the section and is partly or wholly reflected at impedance changes within the member. If any of these returning reflections are in phase with the incident frequency, resonant makes the response of the section maximum. A graph of the maximum velocity against frequency of excitation would therefore show a series of resonating peaks with intervening troughs. This is the main principle Test measurements may be presented either an equi-potential contour map or the cumulative frequency diagram. Impedance at any given level in the section is usually expressed by the relationship below z ρc. eparately analyzed. Trepanning technique is developed to assess the in-situ stress under biaxial stress state. Technique employs a three element strain gage rosette to measure the strain release due to core-drilling. The concrete sample is broken crushed into a fine powder, passing 150 micron sieve preferably 100 micron. Sulphate content of a sample is determined through precipitation of barium sulphate using barium chloride. The method has several disadvantages when compared to the incremental core-drilling method. The cement content of this sample is determined as per the procedure given BS 1881-Pt."

The purpose of bridge repair is similar to the vascular network in a road. Using a metaphor, the road network which serves for the national socio-economic activities such as logistics, travels and communications, is compared to a vascular network. Road infrastructure is essential for Cambodia economy. Bridges crossing rivers are vital components of the road network. Damages or collapses of bridges can risk the lives of road users as well as create serious influence to the entire country. Although maintenance-free is ideal during the designed lifespan, the period when maintenance is needed is very long. Health of structure is reduced by age, but the lifespan is 1-1extendable by appropriate maintenance. Maintenance gives a significant effect on the structures performance level and lifespan. If the current condition and the progress of deterioration can be monitored and identified in the early stage, the recovery can be made with minor repairing. If the deterioration is neglected until reaching to the minimum standard, major repair work is needed for the whole recovery. In order to reduce the burden of future maintenance to minimize the life cycle cost consequently, constant and timely inspection and repair work Bridge component consists of deck slab, superstructure, bearing and substructure pier, abutment and foundation. They all should be carried out promptly based on maintenance plan to ensure structural performance. Bridge configuration consists of two sections superstructure comprising deckfloor and girderbeam. Type of superstructure is categorized in terms of material and structural feature. I- shaped steel and H-shaped steel are most commonly used for steel bridge and called Plate girder bridge. Concrete deck bridge is applied for relatively short span bridge since dead load becomes heavier due to its span length. It is advantageous to shortening construction period and saving workload at the site because of its structural simplicity and workability. Cable stayed bridge steel girder. ce to the cable are equilibrant on both sides of tower. Though this bridge type used to be most economical for center span of up to 400m, recently it is applicable to the span length of more than 800m. Superstructure is the main bridge part comprise deckfloor and girderbeam. Substructure supports superstructure and transmits its load to the ground. Bearings sustain vertical load such as dead load or live load from the superstructure as well as lateral load by wind or earthquake. Lateral bracing resists against wind and seismic force and sway bracing avoids cross-sectional deformation. Drainage pits are set on a certain interval on the bridge surface. Rubber and steel finger type are mainly used. Bank Seat Abutment an abutment set well up the river bank above the usual river level. Barrel the main part of an arch which supports fill and roadway. Boom the upper top chord and lower bottom chord longitudinal members of a truss. 3.3 Bracing parts of a bridge which help to resist lateral forces and keep it stiff so as not to change shape. Bulging where a flat place changes shape and is bent. Camber the slight convexity curve required for construction of bridges. Permanent deformation of steel members can take the form of bending, buckling, twisting or elongation, or any combination of these. Delamination - defined as a discontinuity in the surface concrete which is substantially separated but not completely detached from concrete below or above it. Disintegration - the physical deterioration or breaking down of the concrete into small fragments or particles. Groyne or Spurdike a wall built to change the flow of a river and protect the river bank from scour. Headwall a wall at the end of a culvert to hold the soil fill above the culvert pipe. Gabion wire basket filled with stones. Galvanizing a thin layer of zinc on steel to protect it. Pile a long, thin, foundation driven deep into the ground. Panel a flat frame or plate. Parapet a wall or rail along the edge of bridge. Pre-stressed a way of making concrete stronger with pre-stressing steel bars. Retaining Wall a wall to hold back soil. Riprap layer of loose rocks to protect the river bank from scour. Safety Pins the small clips on a bailey bridge, that Scaling stop the panel pins from falling out. Shrinkage happens when the timber dries up below its fiber saturation point. Spall is an area where concrete has broken away e.g. due to corrosion of reinforcing steel bars. Spandrel Walls are the side walls of a masonry arch bridge. Superstructure all of the deck, including parapets, trusses, beams and running surface. Suspended Span or Drop-in Span the middle span of a cantilever bridge. Tension pulling apart. Upstream the direction where the water is coming from. Vibration repeated small movements caused by a heavy vehicle or perhaps an earthquake.  maintenance is scheduled so as to prevent it from being concentrated in a certain period of time. Preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance are included. Life Cycle Cost LCC Total costs required for future maintenance and operation This is abbreviated to LCC. Design Service Period Period that a structure or member should fully carry out its function. Remaining Scheduled In-service Period Period from inspection or study to the end of scheduled in-service period. Impact on Third Parties Degree of impact on property or injury of a person caused by falling concrete pieces that separated from the structure. Inspection Collective term for diagnostic examinations to discover any abnormalities on the structure or members Monitoring To observe conditions of structures and members through sensors mounted on structures. It is important to conduct a routine maintenance of bridge structures for keeping their sound condition and prolong their lifespan. It is necessary to establish a basic and feasible management cycle as shown in Fig. 2.1 in the management entity. The following chapters prescribe the field of inspection as a core portion of bridge maintenance and clarify the units in charge of each inspection work and its standard procedures. It should be noted that each unit is not independent from others and the mutual cooperation is the key for smooth flow of this inspection cycle. 2.1.1 Inspection and Maintenance Budgeting Schedule MPWT Ministry of Public Work and Transport DPWT Department of Public Works and Transportation MEF Ministry of Economy and Finance 2-32.3 Jurisdiction 2.3.1 Bridge repair Annual implementation plan includes bridge repair location, its volume, methodology and schedule.

The results input in the Bridge Inspection Database System include not only inspection result but also repair result. The unit in charge and the formulation process are as follows. Repair workers in each Road and Brid. The Bridge Road and Bridge Unit, DPWT shall be responsible for inputting the repair result data in the Bridge Inspection Database System. It is preferable that the input shall be done on the site right after the repair unless the site condition is not allowed. The database server of Bridge Inspection Database System shall be in the computer system of the RID. The server shall be kept activated constantly so that anyone can access to the system. Seminars and workshops shall be held in a regular basis i Planning and Technical Office for Road Bridge of RID is responsible for the organization and implementation of national seminars and workshops. Local workshop an information sharing are carried out by each Deputy Director, Bureau of Public Work, DPWT. Construction site are often exposed to the risk of life compared to other industries. Although accident rate of construction work is about 15 in all accidents all injuries and deaths, it is more fatal and more than half of all accidents are caused by construction. Fatal traffic accidents occur more often in repair work than construction work because repair work is likely to be conducted near traffic flow. As a countermeasure of reducing traffic accident, it is effective to put a men-at-work signboar. Accident can be reduced substantially if appropriate safety measures are prepared in advance and arranged during the construction period. It is essential that repair work should be carried out under the condition where worker safety is completely ensured. Supervisor should not be off guard and keep attention even if no accident period continues. Weeds, bushes and trash on the work site sometimes cause workers to stumble or slip, and make scaffoldings unstable. Some trash contains hazardous substances such as glass, cutlery and syringes, and they may be hidden under weeds and bushes. It is important to remove weeds and trash before repair work. All people entering the work site, not only the workers but also the supervisors, must wear the protection helmet. Sandals are not allowed in the site. Rubber protection gloves should be worn in case of using harmful material harmful to skin. Site cleaning should be carried out every day to keep its safe workable condition. Ground around its columns should be leveled or column length should be adjusted so that its floorboards are kept horizontal and stable. Any worker is refrained from smoking in the work site. Work of the day shall be finished and supervisor shall allow workers to dismiss after the confirmation of the contents of next-day work is done. Any waste generated from the work should brought back without leaving in the site. It is necessary to carefully use repair tools. 3-113.2.2 Application Criteria The bridge shall be kept clean and in good condition to prolong its service life. Especially drainage must be cleaned regularly to prevent from the remnant of rainwater which may often trigger the rusting of structural members. el, dirt, and other foreign materials on the areas. All foreign materials such as dirt, dust, sand, rain water, and moss on concrete surfaces in the gaps between girders shall be completely removed manually and then washed using a high pressure water bluster. Inspection vehicle is utilized effective to carry out cleaning of the high bridge soffit parts. Mud and sand deposits at the sides of abutment shall be excavated to maintain its original distance from the river bank. Grass and shrubs around bridge 3-14 shall be removed. Maintenance room includes the scaffolding space on both sides of and under the girders, working space for inspection, repair and strengthening, and any probable room as deemed necessary in the future. Scaffolding also needs enough spaces for suspension devices, workers passage an. Enough working space should be provided as much as possible so that workers can work and move without physical hindrance. Examples of maintenance room are shown in Fig. 4.1.1and Table 4. 1.2. Resting Position Sketch Sketch Standard size m Reference Position Side view Front view Height Width Length standard Short Medium Long 1 Standing Free to Work without restriction 1.8 0.8 1.0 1.1 Free Unable to work unless slightly 2 Hunching 1.5 0.7 1.6 2.0 Supine on floor position lower limbs position 0.6 Lying Unable to working unless lying sideways. Concrete is the mixture of cement, water, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, and admixture. Coarse aggregate has the largest share in cubical volume. Fine aggregate is the sand mass all of which goes through 10mm wire sieve and whose 85 of weight volume go through 5mm one. Cement is the concrete component with gray colored and powdery state and hardened by hydrate and polymerized effects when mixed with water or liquid material. Cement is roughly classified into three types portland cement, blended cement and special cement. The construction stage may cause many problems on strength, durability, water-tightness and external appearance of finished products. Common failures and their countermeasures are shown in the following Fig. 4.3.1. Honeycombing and cavity cause not only poor external appearance but also significant deterioration on durability and water-tightness. When there is a partial areal loss, structural strength may also be decreased. Right mix design based on standard specification is the key to avoid forming voids. Concrete with proper workability should be chosen by considering the size and shape of cross- section and reinforcement arrangement. Sand texture is a phenomenon where the water washes away the cement component and fine aggregated stand out on the surface. To avoid or reduce bubble or sand texture due to bleeding, good workability concrete should be used. Design at pumping Casting Inappropriate casting order Overquick casting Compaction Inappropriate compaction Curing Vibrationloading before setting Overquick drying at initial stage Freezing at curing Casting Joint In inappropriate casting joint Reinforcement Re-bar Random interval placemen Placement Insufficient coverage depth Formwork Form 4.3.4 Cold Joint When massive volume of concrete is casted, the casting is done incrementally. Material discontinuity called cold joint sometimes appear in the boundary section between layers. Cold joint not only becomes the main factor of deterioration on structural strength. When more than two layers of concrete are casted, concrete of upper layer shall be casted before the one of the previous layer begins to be solidified. allowable maximum 4-14casting intervals are set as in Table 4.3.2. Since works are conducted in daytime in Cambodia, target interval should be less 2 hours. Workability is generally determined by the ease with which fresh concrete can be deformed and resistance to the separation of materials. The unit cement concrete shall be determined from the unit water content and water-cement ratio. For the minimum unit cement content, the values in Table 4.3.1 shall be taken. The minimum unit cement content in the pre-tensioning method is stipulated to be larger than in the post-tensionsing method. Because there is a risk of a large water content having a detrimental effect on the structure such as cracking due to thermal stress and drying shrinkage. It is desirable to store materials paying attention to the following matters to ensure their quality. Reinforcing bars and structural steel shall be supported at appropriate spacing and stored in storage facilities. Cement that has been stored for a long period of time is tested to ascertain its quality prior to the use. A plan shall be established beforehand concerning the concrete transport method, transport route, site placed, placement method, placement procedure, amount of one placement, curing method, and construction joint treatment method. ncrete material 4-174.4.3 Concrete work Time from Mixing to Finishing the Placement should be 2 hours or less. If concrete is placed in two or more layers, placement shall be carried out so that an overlying layer becomes integral with an underlying layer. The term allowable placement interval is the time after completion of the placement and compaction of the underlying layer of c. Internal vibrators should be used for compacting concrete. Form vibrators may be used to compact thin walls. Standard allowable placement intervals are shown in Table 4.3. oncrete until the overlying layer of concrete is placed. Internal vibrators must not be used for lateral movement, which may cause segregation. As a rule of thumb, vibration time is about 5 to 15 seconds. Pulling out vibrators slowly is very important to make sure that holes are not left in the concrete. The curing method shall generally be wet curing. Seawater shall not be used for the curing water. The construction joint shall be formed at a position of small shear force and perpendicular to the direction of action of compressive forces on the member. The concrete surface shall be cleared of laitance, loose aggregate or the like and allowed to absorb water before new concrete is placed. Near the construction joint, it is necessary to place stirrups, transverse bars and other reinforcement densely compared to the other parts. Reinforcement shall be assembled firmly using spacers made of concrete or mortar that is equivalent or superior in quality to the body concrete so as not to cause dislocation during concrete placement. Matter including loose rust, mud, oil, paint or others impairs the bond between concrete and reinforcement. When a lap joint is used, the prescribed length shall be lapped and firmly bound by annealed iron wire of 0.9 mm or more in diameter. When reinforcement is exposed for a long time for future extension, it shall be coated with cement paste or shielded by a vinyl cover. The big slump means high workability. But it is not so good for concrete durability. Big slump concrete is easy to produce materials separation, contains much water and produces materials separation easily. So, it is important to minimize the slump water content within the limits of workability for casting. Air content test is to measure air content contained in concrete. Test for Air Content of Freshly Mixed Concrete by the Pressure Method is based on Boyles law, which states that the volume occupied by air is proportional to the applied pressure. Air content test method is as following Fig. 4.5.2. The more amount of air is large, workability of concrete is good. If air is put in too much, compressive strength is reduced. So, suitable air content should be designed. Average compressive strength of three specimens is adopted as the result. Mold should be removed after 16 to 72 hours. Filling the mold with fresh concrete in more or 2 equal layers and each layer is rodded 1 time every 10 times ensure compaction. Sodium chloride in concrete may induce alkali-silica reaction. Test methods to measure the volume of chloride ion concrete includes test strip Quan Tab Test, machine test, and dry analysis method using concrete powder drilled by depth from core samples.

The courts at New Delhi shall alone have the sole and Bridge Inspection Guidelines include a list of various defects likely to be observed in an element. The guidelines are put under two separate categories as detailed below A. Bridge Element These sets of guidelines will be applicable to different elements of the bridge. Each will be unique to that element. Concrete 2. Steel 3. Elastomer included in bearings C. Culverts B. Ancillaries footpath, trolly refuge, walkway, OHE mast, pipeline. Inspection of the river flow conditions, and river training works is best carried out during the floods or immediately after the end of the monsoon season. River change the course of their flow frequently. Human activity like farming, mining and navigation also has an effect on river flow.  guide bunds are made to channelize the flow of the river through the bridge and prevent a meandering river from outflanking the bridge. The embankment of guide bund is protected against scour by laying launching apron at its toe. Launch of crates of the apron on the river side are normal and should not be considered as a defect. Inspection engineer should be on a look out for erosion of embankment soil either by river flow or from rainwater. Soil erosion need to be addressed urgently before the onset of the net monsoon season. The purpose of this is to identify any signs of extreme meandering of the river which threatens to outflank the bridge. Spurs or groynes are flexible or rigid hydraulic structure built from a riverbank that interrupts water flow and limits the movement of sediment. Spurs can be attracting, deflecting, or repelling. The floor apron consists of in-erodible material like concrete, flat gabion boxes or some other type of paving. An apron can fail by abrasive action of the river or by the river gouging out material locally from the apron.  approach embankments, though not a part of the bridge structure, are important to maintain integrity of the abutment. The construction of and protection provided to an approach bank is more or less similar to that of the embankment of a guide bund. Inspection of the approach embankment should include the following aspects. Inspection of foundations 2.0. Foundations of bridges are classified as Deep foundations and shallowopen foundations. The main difficulty with inspection of bridge foundations is the lack of accessibility of the foundation. On DFCCIL system, the deep foundations comprise of either well foundation or pile foundation. These foundations transfer the loads and forces from the superstructure to such depths where competent strata is obtained. It is neither advisable nor practical to excavate the soil around the foundation solely for the purpose of inspection. Scour of the riverbed is a dynamic phenomenon and it keeps fluctuating with the flood conditions. Unless the scour is measured during the peak floods or during receding floods, it is unlikely to be observable later on. Normally any tilt of the foundation in the cross dir. and verticality. Tilt along the traffic direction may not readily manifest in the track structure. For most inspections, visual observation of the verticality of the foundation is enough. Settlement should be kept under continuous observation, preferably by installing instruments. All shallow foundations on DFCCIL are made using concrete as a structural element. For defects related to concrete in the shallow foundation, please refer to the guideline for inspection of Concrete structures. Marking of HFL and danger level is a standard practice. Settlement in shallow foundation may also manifest by disturbance in the soil strata surface surrounding the foundation. If a protective floor apronpitching has been laid on the bed, there may be signs of separation between the edge of the footing and the apron. Inspection Engineer has to use his technical knowledge and diagnostic skills in case of any sign of distress related to the shallow foundations. erosion of the soil from under the raft. In some cases, like the archBox bridge, there is little to differentiate between substructure and superstructure. On the DFCCIL system, all piers are made in concrete. Pile caps are the point of transition between the be inspected in a pier. Guidelines for inspecting piers and abutments are given below separately. To cross check the verticalitytilt of the pier, slope of the top surface of the wellpile cap and pier cap should be measured using a spirit level. If the tilt is suspected, close inspection of seating of bearings on pedestal may be carried out. Some special cases, bridges in navigable rivers are provided with fenders to protect it against impact of bargesships. For defects in concrete as a material please refer to a separate guideline on the subject. Portions of the pier lying between HFL and LWL should be given greater attention. Wing walls and return walls are also additional elements of an abutment. Presence of soil around the bed block level increases the possibility of damage due to soil and vegetation. Abutments are subject to active earth pressure and tractivebraking forces in the longitudinal direction. Bulging is a local manifestation of the effect of earth pressure on the walls of the abutment. It is a less serious defect than settlement and tilt as it does not point towards global instability. These areas should be thoroughly examined for signs of cracks. During inspection, one should look out for signs of proper functioning of the weep holes. There are brown stain marks on the walls left by the water draining from the weep hole. Growth of vegetation in the cracks and areas around the dirt wall, bed block and wing walls can result in pressure on the concrete. Bearings are amongst the most critical part of a bridge. Malfunctioning of bearings can result in large forces developing in the superstructure andor substructure. Pedestals on which the bearing rests is also treated as a part of the bearing unit. Inadequate edge distance can result in failure of the pedestal. Over loading or low in-situ strength or pre-existing non-structural shrinkage cracks can lead to more severe cracking or spalling. The checklist for inspection of pedestals is given below. All elastomeric bearings on DFCCIL are reinforced type with steel plates embedded within the elastomers. The space around the bearing and pedestal should be free of any obstruction which can prevent free movement and rotation of the bearing. Elastomeric bearings accommodate horizontal movements by shear strain. While some amount of rotation is to be expected, excessive rotation differential compression in elastomers should trigger investigation. The temperature should also be noted down as it has a direct impact on the thermal expansioncontraction. Under the vertical loads, the elastomers compress and also bulge over the free edges. Slight bulging of theElastomers between the embedded steel plates is a sign that the bearing is participating in load transfer. Excessive bulging in some bearing or in some elastomer layer in a bearing reveal abnormality in load sharing. These should be noted down and reported. The bearing should be in full contact with the soffit of the girder above and the top surface of the pedestal below. Any gap in either of the two contact faces is not a healthy sign and needs to be noted down. A neoprene pot bearing has a stainless-steel plate that is attached to the sole plate. Pot bearing and spherical bearing can be divided into three types fixed spherical bearing, guided spherical bearing and free sliding spherical bearing. Guide bars in the expansion pot bearing restrict transverse movement. A fixed bearing version of this configuration does not possess the stainless-steel plate or the PTFE disc. Pot bearing movement can be measured in the same way as for a sliding plate bearing. The movement is one half of the difference between the front and back distances of the top and bottom plates. If the pot bearing allows movement in two directions, the inspection Engineer should measure transverse movement as well. The temperature at which the measurements are taken should also be recorded. Corrosion should be nipped in the bud by early detection and surface protection measures. Any sign of elastomer on the outer surface indicates that the neoprene element is extruded from the pot. Examine pot bearings for proper seating of the various elements with respect to one another. Check to see that the neoprene pad is properly seated within the pot. Also check if all the bolts connecting the bearing with the girder are properly tightened. Look for any build-up of dirt and debris in and around the bearing. The top and bottom parts of the bearing are bolted to each other to facilitate safe transportation and installation. Post installation, the plates locking the two parts together should be removed to permit free movement.  DFCCIL superstructure also carries footpath, trolley refuges, OHE and utility crossings. This guideline covers inspection of different structural forms of the superstructure. Guidelines for inspection of steel as a structural material is covered under a separate guideline. Midspan deflection should be measured on one fixed point at the midspan on either side, and average of the two values reported as the mid span deflection. The amount of deflection for small spans is not large and slight error in measurement may give misleading results. A more useful purpose of recording the midspan deflection is to track it with passage of time and develop a time-deflection chart. Check whether the outlet of the drainpipe is discharging the water at an inappropriate place of the substructure or crossing below. Superstructure is in direct contact with the live loads. This could either be due to over ballasting or some local damage to the retainer. Any abnormal behavior of the superstructure or any latent defect may manifest through unusual deflection and vibration. I girders are an open section whereas the box is a closed section. The box girder is more likely to be pre-stressed as compared to the I girder. Instead of just measuring deflection at mid-span, it is better to measure the camber as it provides more reliable information.  Reference points should be made on either side of the track and separate camber diagrams can be drawn for the up and down face. Anchorage is a point along the pre-stressing cable in post tensioned system where the prestressing system is most vulnerable. Some areas need greater attention as these are known to be points of greater stress and locations where distress is seen more often. Steel plate girders are welded type and all field joints are bolted HSFG bolts. Steel girders being lighter than concrete girder, exhibit larger vibration under traffic. Engineer should also be alert for any resonance that may be felt during passage of trains. Check members for cleanliness and freedom from debris. Unclean members should be especially s Members subjected to compressive forces are prone to distortion and buckling. Most compression members can bendtwist which can reduce their effectiveness significantly. Cleaning may be necessary to properly inspect the members for cracks and corrosion. Joints with HSFG bolts are designed to transfer the forces through friction between the contact surfaces of the connected members and plates. If the force on the joint exceeds the service loads, the joints can slip. Slip of the joint may indicate that the loads have, sometimes in the past, exceeded the serviceability stage limit. Apping the bolt with a hammer is not allowed.  defects in steel material of construction may be visible anywhere in the girder and these should all be recorded with specific location of each defect pinpointed. Given below is a list of locations which are more critical and the chances of finding defects at such places is higher than other locations. Open web girders are not provided with ballasted deck and given their longer spans, adequate and safe access and walkways are crucial to facilitate effective inspection and maintenance. All walkways, footpaths, railings, ladders and access to trolleymam refuges should be examined as a part of inspection. Camber is provided in the girder to compensate for deflection under load. Camber should be retained during service life of the girders if there is no distress. Any loss of camber should be investigated and brought on record. Local buckling indicates overstress of compression members. Wrinkling in the flange, webs or cover plates are common signs of buckling. Defect in the steel material of construction may be visible anywhere in the girder. The track structure represents interface between the bridge and the live load. Strictly speaking, the track structure is a part of track inspection and maintenance. The behavior of the track on the bridge is different from that on the embankment and therefore deserves to be separated from routine track inspection. Details of the treatment of LWR over the bridge should be carefully studied so that relevant features of the same can be properly inspected. Any kink in the alignment of the track especially over a pier suggests some abnormal situation related to that pier. The level of track provides the earliest warning sign about settlement in any of the foundations or any other distress like tilt or shift. LWR may or may not have been continued over the bridge depending upon its overall length, rail section used and the temperature zone in which it falls. Detailed level measurements may be recorded if there are visual signs of disturbance in the track levels. The condition of the ballast wall should be checked for at least up to 50 meters on the 86 Pageapproaches. This portion of the track should be well anchored. The gauge, cross level and packing under the sleepers should also be checked. As many sleeper seats as possible should be closely inspected to get an idea of the general condition of the trackgirder interface. Corrosion in sleepers, local damage to any sleeper and condition of welds should be inspected. Condition of guard rail and its fastening should also be checked. Inspection of ancillary structures is important from this perspective. It should be checked whether the footpath provides safe and uninterrupted surface. Inspection of Bridge Ancillaries 7.0 does not by themselves affect the safetystability of the bridge. Ladders are provided to allow access form the track to the top of the pier cap. The integrity of the hand railing should be checked. Trolleyman refuges are provided for parking of inspection trollies or for standing during passage of trains. Connection of the trolleyman refuge structure to the main bridge should be examined carefully for its integrity. Defects in the material of construction concrete or steel should be checked as per the respective guideline for concrete and steel. iance with the applicable DFCCIL Schedule of Dimensions. Inspect the bracket suspenders of pipelinecable support as structural elements. Inspect these for distortion, corrosion and integrity of bolts etc. A pipeline that carries any hazardous material poses a risk of fire and explosion. The integrity of the height gauge should be observed and recorded. gauges are provided to prevent the road vehicles carrying over dimensioned consignment ODC damaging the soffit of the girders. A RCC BoxPipe is typically embedded so as to be surrounded by soil of the embankment. The items to be inspected in a RCc boxpipe are detailed below. The most commonly noticed defect in a RCC BoxPipe is the settlement of a part of it resulting in disturbance to the slopelevelvertical alignment. Unless designed as a siphon, the RCC BoxPipe should have adequate clearance to allow flow of water. Signs of HFL should be looked for to assess if design clearance is available. Inspect the wing face wall for its alignmentverticality and signs of undermining. Check for integrity of the flooring on the approach to the RCC BoxPipe bridges. Look for angle of entry of the stream and any obstruction to direct entry of water into the bridges. Typica defects to be looked for include cracks, spalling, erosion and rebar corrosion. The following defects are always construction defects and do not occur during the operation period. Honeycombs b. Bug holes c. Cold joints d. Construction joints e. Off set at formwork joints f. Less cover to reinforcement g. Shadow of rebar on concrete surface h. Foreign material embedded in concrete 9.1 These include the following a. Cracks b. Delamination and spalling c. Efflorescence d. Rebar corrosion e. Damaged broken edges f. Blisters or pop outs g. Surface abrasion dusting. Cracks in concrete are amongst the most common defect and some of these can be very serious. Delamination or spalling of concrete represent an advanced stage of corrosion of reinforcement. If the defect is located at a structurally critical location, do not aggravate the problem by further taping the concrete. Delamination and spalling are invariably accompanied by visible cracks in the concrete neararound it. Efflorescence is the presence of salt on the concrete surface, often at the cracks. It is a sign of passage of water through the concrete and leaching out of lime.  corrosion of rebar will be generally accompanied by cracks in concrete. Efflorescence, if noticed along with a crack will get covered by item aviii above. If noticed without a crack, its location and size should be noted down. A cold joint or a poorly located and formed construction joint creates a plane of weakness in the concrete element. Bug holes are small air voids visible on the surface of concrete. These can vary from less than a mm in size to as large as 20-25 mm. Large bug holes if too many in number and located at a critical position can result in a serious defect. The location and subjective assessment of size of the larger bug holes may be recorded. edge of concrete element could be damaged at the time or removal of the formwork or during construction and erection of other elements. The severity of the defect will depend on its location and depth of damage. Less cover to rebar is not visible after all concrete has been cast. In some case, such as underside of slabs and beams, impression of reinforcement can be seen indicating very low cover. If such parts are accessible, these should be inspected from touching distance. Blister and pop outs are very local defects and indicated by an irregular cavity on the concrete surface. Not all defects are serious in nature. Some defects are created at the time of construction itself and continue to remain in the absence of repairs. This guideline provides a list of all possible defects in steel and what observations should be made to assist in assessing their severity and decide corrections. While this guideline is common to all types of structures, the degree of severity will vary depending on the location of the defects. L superstructure elements are serious in nature, due to fatigue criticality of these elements. In case cracks are seen or suspected, the location should be cleaned with a wire brush and examined closely under adequate light. If 95 Pagerequired DPT may also be carried out to assess the length of the crack. Oxygen, water and chloride are essential for corrosion of steel. Proper drainage is important to reduce the risk of corrosion. Members and connections subject to high stress fluctuations and stress reversals in service are the most common suspect. Paint is the main defence against corrosion of steel structures. Condition of paint and extent of corrosion are two sides of the same coin. If the paint is free of defect, corrosion is unlikely. However, some cases, corrosion initiated from a small scratch can lead to wider loss of paint protection. Loss of adhesion peeling refers to complete loss of bond between the paint and the substrate. In aggressive environments, this can soon initiate widespread corrosion of the steel. Localised damage scratch is either a construction stage defect caused by damage to paint during transportation and launching which was not touched up. Poor processing of the primers will leave hygroscopicwater soluble substances salts behind as contaminants. These cause a local concentration of a saltwater solution which lift the paint film into water blisters. Blisters can occur in many sizes, patterns and frequency and form between individual layers or beneath the entire film build. The entire structure should be carefully inspected from close quarters. Crack starts and can grow fast and seriously reduce the strength of the member. elves are prone to fatigue damage welds are more sensitive to the repeated stresses. The Numerical Rating System for bridge inspection assigns a Unique Rating Number URN to represent the physical condition of a bridge. The CRN is allotted to each of the above components based on their condition at the time of inspection. From the CRNs for different components of a bridge, an overall Rating Number ORN for the bridge is then given. The ORN is the lowest of the seven CRNs of abridge, except 0. If in any bridge, one or more components do not exist, the CRN for such components shall be shown as 6. In any component is not inspected the assign CRN as 0. The aim of creating an objective assessment cannot be met unless there is uniformity in assigning CRN to various elements of the bridge. Assigning a CRN depends on the experience and judgment of the inspecting official. A guideline is required which shall be reviewed from time to time and improved with experience. In the event of an accident on the bridge or -- -- major earthquake or storm, where there was a disruption in traffic and the bridge has been restored using temporary arrangements.
